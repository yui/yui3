# MyComponent Build Properties

# As long as the 'builder' project is cloned to the default folder
# next to the 'yui3' project folder, the 'builddir' property does not 
# need to be changed
#
# If the 'builder' project is checked out to an alternate location, this
# property should be updated to point to the checkout location.
