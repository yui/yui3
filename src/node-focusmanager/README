**** YUI 3.1.0 ***

*   Updated the "refresh" method so that it will set up event listeners if they 
    haven't yet been set up enabling the Focus Manager to be plugged into 
    an empty Node with the focusable descendants to be added later.

**** YUI 3.0.0 ***

*   Fixed issue where mousing down on a child node of a descendant would
    result in the descendant losing focus
