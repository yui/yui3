Widget Modality Change History
==============================

  * Fixed focus-contention issues which caused infinite recursion when multiple
    modal Panels were visible on the page at the same time. [Ticket #2530953]

  * It is now possible to instantiate a Widget that uses the WidgetModality
    extension without needing to pass in a configuration Object.
