<div class="intro">
<p>This example shows how to create a `Dial` widget using an image 
that surrounds (or is larger than) the Dial.</p>
</div>

<div class="example yui3-skin-sam">
    {{>dial-image-surrounding-source}}
</div>

<h3>Creating a Dial and Surrounding It With a Larger Image</h3>

<p>Some cases may require a `Dial` that has an image surrounding it such as tick marks, units, or other
visual enhancements. These images can be larger than the ring of the dial and therefore may not fit as a background image.
To provide for this use case, an extra image object will need to be added to the DOM.</p>

<p>
In this example we'll simulate the climate control on an car dashboard.
The image we'll add contains two curved wedges of color, blue and red, that wrap around the dial,
signifying the temperature of air conditioning or heat.
</p>

<h4>The Markup</h4>
{{>need-skin-note}}
```
<body class="yui3-skin-sam"> {{>need-skin-comment}}
```
<p>The only markup requirement is a div to contain the `Dial`.</p>

```
<div id="demo"></div>
```

<h4>The JavaScript</h4>

<p>The same JavaScript can be used as in the basic Dial example, with a bit of
extra code to add the image object.</p>

<p>Some commonly used configuration attributes are shown below. 
This example also shows how to modify the visible UI strings before the `Dial` renders.</p>
```
YUI().use('dial', function(Y) {

    var dial = new Y.Dial({
        min: -90,
        max: 90,
        stepsPerRevolution: 200,
        value: 0,
        diameter: 100
    });
    //Setting visible HTML strings before Dial renders.
    dial.set('strings',{'label':'Climate:', 'resetStr':'Off', 'tooltipHandle':'Drag for cool or heat.'});
    dial.render("#demo");

});
```


<h4>Inserting the Image</h4>
<p>After rendering the `Dial`, we create and insert the image object.</p>
```
//Create an image node.
var im = Y.Node.create('<img src="{{{dialPathAssets}}}/images/cold_hot.png"/>');
    
//Position it absolutely to the correct spot depending on it's size.
im.setStyles({'position':'absolute', 'top':'-3px', 'left':'-9px'});
    
//Insert it in the DOM.
//The north-mark is the first object inside the ring.
//depending on the image, you may need to insert it before the yui3-dial-label 
Y.one('.yui3-dial-north-mark').insert(im, 'before');
```

<h4>The CSS</h4>
<p> 
In the CSS, we're just cleaning out the visible styles of the ring and the 
center button to allow for the images.
