Dial Widget

3.3.0
  * New Beta Component
	Deprecated _setLabelString, _setTooltipString, _setResetString. 
	Instead, use DialObjName.set('strings',{'label':'My new label', 'resetStr';'My New Reset'});   before DialObjName.render();
	One or more strings can be changed at a time.
	Removed _setXYResetString. Now done through CSS. Not called by Dial.js anymore.

3.4.0 PR1
  * Names of 3 configuration attributes have changed:
	stepsPerRev       ->   stepsPerRevolution
	handleDist        ->   handleDistance
	centerButtonDia   ->   centerButtonDiameter 
	 
  * New configuration attributes:
	markerDiameter
	handleDiameter
	
  * Enhancement:
  	In addition to setting the Dial by dragging the handle as it was in 3.3.0, Dial now supports setting the value by clicking on the Ring.
	This does not cross value "wrapping" boundries. 
	For example: If a Dial has 0 degrees = value 0, 
	and the Dial's current handle position is 10 degrees with a value = 10, 
	then a mousedown at 355 degrees will result in a value of 355 not -10.
	In this case all mousedown events will result in values between 0 and 355. This is within current value "wrapping" boundries.
	Moving across value wrapping boundaries, must be done by dragging the handle or using the keyboard.

  * Changed the name of class 
	marker-max-min
	- to - 
	yui3-dial-marker-max-min
	
  * Enhancement:
	In 3.3.0, when the user dragged the handle past the min or max, the Marker displayed as red to indicate min/max.
	When the cursor was released, the marker was no longer displayed. There remained no user feedback indicating max/min.
	When the keyboard was used to change the value, no min/max indication was displayed, except that the handle stopped moving.
	In this release, the Marker display state of red remains as long as the Dial is at min/max, regardless of mouse or keyboard use.
	If you don't want min/max feedback, CSS class yui3-dial-marker-max-min can be overridden.
