    <p>When CSS Reset is included in a page it removes the browser-provided style of HTML elements (by generally setting values to 0). This example shows what that looks like.</p>

</div>

<div class="example newwindow">
    <a href="cssreset-basic-example.html" target="_blank" class="button">
        View Example in New Window
    </a>
</div>

<h3>Note:</h3>
<p>Because CSS examples are susceptible to other CSS on the page, this example is only available in a new window at the above link.</p>
