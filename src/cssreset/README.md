CSS Reset Utility
===============

Note: The files "reset.css" and "reset-context.css" are deprecated, use "cssreset.css" and
"cssreset-context.css" instead.

The foundational CSS Reset removes the inconsistent styling
of HTML elements provided by browsers. This creates a 
dependably flat foundation to built upon. With CSS Reset 
loaded, begin writing the explicit CSS your project needs.
