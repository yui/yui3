ScrollView is a new component, which leverages the 
synthetic gesture layer, normalizing touch and mouse
based input added in 3.2. It also leverages the transitions 
normalization layer added in 3.2 to optimize animation
performance.

The scrollview/tests/manual folder contains basic 
examples of vertical, horizontal and paged scrolling 
for the preview release.

3.3.0

* Fixed shared scrollbar node across multiple instances.
* Changed async call to _uiDimensionsChange after render to a sync call.
* Corrected skin prefix to be yui3-skin-sam instead yui-skin-sam.
* Refactored for kweight, and broke out scrollview-base-ie conditional module.
* Don't prevent default on gesturemoveend, so that click listeners on elements
  inside the scrollview respond reliably. Panning is still prevented by
  preventing gesturemousemove.

3.2.0

* New beta component
