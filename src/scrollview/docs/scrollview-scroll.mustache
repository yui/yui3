<div class="intro">
    <p>This example shows how to create a ScrollView widget with a scrollbar indicator.  It also illustrates a technique for suppressing link behavior during a scroll &mdash; a technique you may require if you have a ScrollView instance heavily populated by links, as in this example.</p>

<h2>The ScrollView Widget With A Scroll Indicator</h2>

<p>In this example, we'll create a ScrollView instance, which also has a scrollbar indicator.</p>

<h3>Modules Used</h3>

<p>Since we want to use the base ScrollView, along with the ScrollViewScrollbars plugin, which provides the scrollbar indicator we use the `scrollview` module, instead of the `scrollview-base` module we used for the basic ScrollView example:</p>

```
// Pulls in scrollview-base and scrollview-scrollbars plugin
// and plugs it in (at the class level)

YUI().use('scrollview', function(Y) {
    ...
});
```

<p>The `scrollview` module pulls in the basic ScrollView and also the ScrollViewScrollbars plugin. It has code which plugs the scrollbar plugin into the ScrollView base class:</p>

```
Y.Base.plug(Y.ScrollView, Y.Plugin.ScrollViewScrollbars);
```

<h3>Instantiating The ScrollView Widget</h3>

{{>need-skin-note}}
```
<body class="yui3-skin-sam"> {{>need-skin-comment}}
```

<p>As with the <a href="scrollview-base.html">Base ScrollView</a> example, we provide the markup for the ScrollView content on the page, as shown below:</p>

```
<div id="scrollview-content" class="yui3-scrollview-loading">
    <ul>
        <li>AC/DC</li>
        <li>Aerosmith</li>
        <li>Billy Joel</li>
        <li>Bob Dylan</li>
        ...
    </ul>
</div>
```

<p>And we instantiate the ScrollView instance in the same way, providing the `srcNode` attribute during construction, so it uses the markup above for it's content:</p>

```
YUI().use('scrollview', function(Y) {

    var scrollView = new Y.ScrollView({
        id: "scrollview",
        srcNode: '#scrollview-content',
        height: 310,
        flick: {
            minDistance:10,
            minVelocity:0.3,
            axis: "y"
        }
    });

    scrollView.render();
});
```

<p>Again, for this example, since we want a vertically scrolling ScrollView widget, we also give it a height during construction and constrain flicks to the "y" axis.</p>

<p>As the last step, to see the functional ScrollView on the page, we call `scrollView.render()`.</p>

<p>The only difference, compared to the <a href="scrollview-base.html">Base ScrollView</a> example, is that the ScrollViewScrollbars plugin has been pulled down and plugged in by the `scrollview` module code shown above, so the ScrollView now has a scroll indicator. The scroll indicator is styled with rounded corners in browsers which support CSS rounded corners natively.</p>

<h3>Accessing The Scrollbars Plugin API</h3>

<p>As discussed in the <a href="index.html#scrollbars">ScrollBar Plugin</a> documentation, the API to control scrollbars is available on the scrollview instance, through the `scrollView.scrollbars` property. The ScrollBar plugin doesn't have too complex of an api, just a few methods to hide and show the scrollbars:</p>

```
    /*
      scrollView.scrollbars is an instance of the ScrollViewScrollbars plugin
    */
    scrollView.scrollbars.hide();
    scrollView.scrollbars.show();
    scrollView.scrollbars.flash();
});
```

<h3>Suppressing Default Link Behavior</h3>

<p>In this example, the scrolling surface is populated with links. To prevent links' default action (page navigation) from taking place after a scroll, we look at the `lastScrolledAmt` property of our ScrollView instance; on a simple click, that number will be very close to zero, whereas after scroll that number will be much higher.  In this case, we're using a 2px threshold.</p>

```
var content = scrollView.get("contentBox");

content.delegate("click", function(e) {
    // Prevent links from navigating as part of a scroll gesture
    if (Math.abs(scrollView.lastScrolledAmt) > 2) {
        e.preventDefault();
        Y.log("Link behavior suppressed.")
    }
}, "a");
```

<p>We also prevent default on mousedown, to prevent the native "drag link to desktop" behavior on certain browsers.</p>

```
content.delegate("mousedown", function(e) {
    // Prevent default anchor drag behavior, on browsers
    // which let you drag anchors to the desktop
    e.preventDefault();
}, "a");
```
