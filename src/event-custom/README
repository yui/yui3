YUI Custom Events
    Custom event system

3.0.0b1
    - Implemented the broadcast flag.  broadcast = 1: local, accessible
      via Y.on('prefix:event'). broadcast = 2: global, accessible
      via Y.on or globally via Y.Global.on('prefix:event).  Broadcast 
      listeners cannot effect the defaultFn or host subscribers (so
      are in effect, after listeners), although this is still possible
      by added either Y or Y.Global as event targets.
    - Moved custom event out of event package
    - Event.Target accepts a prefix configuration.  This is used
      in all exposed methods to handle shortcuts to event names,
      e.g., 'click' and 'menu:click' are the same if the prefix
      is 'menu'
    - Exposed methods are 'on' for the before moment, 'after' for
      the after moment, and 'detach' for unsubscribe.  subscribe,
      before, unsubscribe, and corresponding methods are deprecated.
