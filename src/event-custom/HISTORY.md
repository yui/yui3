Custom Event Infrastructure Change History
==========================================

3.4.1
-----

  * onceAfter (added in 3.4.0) now works for array and object signatures.
    [Ticket #2531121]

3.4.0
-----

  * Custom events published from `Y` no longer bubble by default.

3.3.0
-----

  * Undocumented and poorly named `each()` method on EventHandle changed to
    `batch()`.

  * After listeners for events fired in a `defaultFn` or listener are queued in
    the correct order.

  * Added `Y.Do.originalRetVal` and `Y.Do.currentRetVal` statics accessible by
    `Y.Do.after()` subscribers.

  * Exposed the previously private `EventTarget.parseType`.

3.2.0
-----

  * Fixed `defaultTargetOnly` publish configuration.

  * `detach()` now decrements `subCount`/`afterCount`.

  * Detaching via category no longer affects subscriptions on other objects.

3.1.1
-----

  * No changes.

3.1.0
-----

  * Wildcard prefix subscriptions supported: `target.on('*:click', â€¦)` will be
    notified when `tree:click`, `tab:click`, etc are fired.

  * Added `EventTarget::once`, which is equivalent to `on()`, except the
    listener automatically detaches itself once executed.

  * Added event monitoring. When configured, an `EventTarget` will emit events
    for `publish()`, `attach()`, `fire()`, and `detach()` operations on the
    hosted events.

  * `EventTarget::on`'s `type` parameter is overloaded to accept arrays and
    objects for attaching multiple types at once.

  * `EventTarget::detach` returns the event target like the API docs already
    stated.

  * Events can now be configured to execute the `defaultFn` only on the targeted
    object, not on the bubble targets.

  * The event order has been reworked so that the after listeners for the entire
    event stack execute after all `defaultFn` across the entire bubble stack.

3.0.0
-----

  * Broken into core base and complex modules.

  * `broadcast` works for simple events.

  * If configured to return an `EventHandle`, the return value will always be a
    single object, regardless of how many listeners were attached. Previously,
    multiple listeners provided an array of detach handles.

3.0.0beta1
----------

  * [!] Exposed methods are `on()` for the before moment, `after()` for the
    after moment, and `detach()` for unsubscribe. `subscribe()`, `before()`,
    `unsubscribe()`, and corresponding methods are deprecated.
  
  * Implemented the `broadcast` flag:
  
    * `broadcast = 1`: local, accessible via `Y.on('prefix:event')`.
    * `broadcast = 2`: global, accessible via `Y.on()` or globally via
      `Y.Global.on('prefix:event')`.
  
    Broadcast listeners cannot effect the `defaultFn` or host subscribers (so
    are in effect, after listeners), although this is still possible by added
    either `Y` or `Y.Global` as `EventTarget`s.

  * Moved `event-custom` out of `event` package.

  * `EventTarget` accepts a `prefix` configuration. This is used in all exposed
    methods to handle shortcuts to event names, e.g., `'click'` and
    `'menu:click'` are the same if the prefix is `'menu'`.

  * Event type accepts a event category which can be used to detach events:
  
        Y.on('category|prefix:event', fn);
        Y.detach('category|prefix:event');
        Y.detach('category|*');

  * Added `chain` config to events that makes the return value the event target
    rather than a detach handle. Use with the detach category prefix.

  * The `type` parameter can be an object containing multiple events to attach:
  
        Y.on({ 'event1': fn1, 'event2': fn2 });

  * `Y.fire` payload for event facades can be another facade or a custom event.
