        The Custom Event framework is one of the principle communication
        mechanisms in YUI.  An object can be augmented with
        <code>EventTarget</code>, enabling it to be both a host and a target
        for custom events.  Custom events fire from their host and optionally
        bubble up to one or more targets.  This allows you to make the
        interesting moments of your applications broadly available within a
        module, within a set of modules, or throughout a complex interface
        populated with rich elements.
    </p>

    <p>
        In this example, a simple custom event is illustrated:
        <code>testEvent</code>.  This custom event is hosted on a Publisher
        object and bubbles up to a BubbleTarget object.
    </p>

    <p>
        Like DOM events, custom event bubbling can be stopped with
        `e.stopPropagation()` and default behavior can be suppressed with
        `e.preventDefault()`.
