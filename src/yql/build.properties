# MyComponent Build Properties

# As long as the 'builder' project is cloned to the default folder
# next to the 'yui3' project folder, the 'builddir' property does not 
# need to be changed
#
# If the 'builder' project is checked out to an alternate location, this
# property should be updated to point to the checkout location.

# The name of the component. E.g. event, attribute, widget

# NOTE: For a css component (e.g. cssfonts, cssgrids etc.) use component.cssfiles instead.

# The list of modules this component requires. Used to setup the Y.add module call for YUI 3.
# NOTE: For a css component, this property is not used/required.

# component.use, component.supersedes, component.optional and component.skinnable are other properties which can be defined
