AutoComplete
============

Provides automatic input completion or suggestions for text input fields and
textareas.


Change History
--------------

3.4.0

  * Added the ability to use a <select> node as a result source.

  * Function sources may now be either asynchronous or synchronous. Returning
    an array of results from a function source will cause it to be treated as
    synchronous (same as in 3.3.0). For async operation, don't return anything,
    and pass an array of results to the provided callback function when the
    results become available. [Ticket #2529974]

  * Added a `sourceType` attribute to `AutoCompleteBase`, which may be used to
    force a specific source type, overriding the automatic source type
    detection. [Ticket #2529974]

  * Added subWordMatch filters and highlighters. [Contributed by Tobias
    Schultze]

  * Added an `originEvent` property to the event facade of `select` events. It
    contains an event facade of the DOM event that triggered the selection if
    the selection was triggered by a DOM event.

  * Small performance improvement for filters and highlighters operating on
    empty query strings. [Ticket #2529949]

  * Result list alignment is now updated both when results change and when
    the window is resized instead of only when the list becomes visible. This
    makes right-aligned lists with dynamic widths less awkward.

  * Fixed a bug that prevented CSS-based z-index values from taking effect on
    the AutoComplete list and required the z-index to be set via JS. The
    .yui3-aclist class now provides a default z-index of 1, and this can be
    overridden with custom CSS. Specifying a 'zIndex' attribute value via JS
    no longer has any effect.

  * Fixed a bug that caused the IE6 iframe shim under the AutoComplete list to
    be sized incorrectly the first time the list was displayed.

  * Fixed a bug in which the requestTemplate would sometimes be used as the
    query instead of being appended to the source URL. This affected XHR and
    JSONP sources that used both a {query} placeholder in the source string and
    a custom requestTemplate value. [Ticket #2529895]

3.3.0

  * Initial release.
