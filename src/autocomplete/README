Change History
--------------

3.3.0pr2

  * Result filters, highlighters, and formatters now all receive a single array
    of result objects. Previously, filters received an array of raw results, 
    highlighters received an array of strings, and formatters received several 
    arrays of various result formats.

    Filters, highlighters, and formatters written for 3.3.0pr1 will need to be 
    updated to handle result objects. See the API docs for the autocomplete-base 
    "results" event for more details on the result object structure.

3.3.0pr1

  * Initial release.
