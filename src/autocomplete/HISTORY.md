3.6.0
-----

* Fixed an issue that prevented events from being detached when the AutoComplete
  widget was destroyed. [Ticket #2532419]


3.5.1
-----

* Fixed a potential XSS issue involving the ARIA live region and text results
  that contain HTML markup.


3.5.0
-----

* Added an `enableCache` config attribute. Set this to `false` to prevent the
  built-in result sources from caching results (it's `true` by default).

* The `requestTemplate` value is now made available to YQL sources via the
  `{request}` placeholder, which works just like the `{query}` placeholder. Use
  this when you need to customize the query value (such as double-escaping it)
  used in the YQL query. [Ticket #2531285]

* Changing the value of the `value` attribute programmatically will now also
  update the value of the `query` attribute and will fire a `clear` event when
  the value is cleared (thus clearing results), but still will not fire a
  `query` event. Use the `sendRequest()` method to trigger a query
  programmatically.

* Added a workaround for an IE7 bug that would cause the result list to appear
  empty when it first becomes visible.

* Fixed a bug that caused a scrollable result list to be hidden when the user
  clicked and dragged on the scrollbar and then released the mouse button while
  the cursor was outside the list region.

* Fixed a bug that caused the list to disappear on mouseover if the input field
  received focus before the AutoComplete widget was initialized
  [Ticket #2531651]

* Fixed a bug that could prevent results from being selected via mouse click
  after a result was selected via the tab key. [Ticket #2531684]

* Fixed a bug that prevented the list from being re-aligned when the window was
  resized.


3.4.1
-----

* The "combobox" ARIA role is no longer automatically added to an
  AutoCompleteList input node. After consulting with the Y! Accessibility
  team, we felt that the combobox role doesn't accurately represent the
  out-of-the-box interactions that AutoCompleteList provides. Implementers can
  still apply this role (or any other ARIA role) to the input node manually if
  desired.

* Fixed a bug that prevented the autocomplete list from being hidden after
  right-clicking on the list and then clicking elsewhere in the document.
  [Ticket #2531009]


3.4.0
-----

* Added the ability to use a `<select>` node as a result source.

* Function sources may now be either asynchronous or synchronous. Returning
  an array of results from a function source will cause it to be treated as
  synchronous (same as in 3.3.0). For async operation, don't return anything,
  and pass an array of results to the provided callback function when the
  results become available. [Ticket #2529974]

* Added a `sourceType` attribute to `AutoCompleteBase`, which may be used to
  force a specific source type, overriding the automatic source type
  detection. [Ticket #2529974]

* The `scrollIntoView` config option is now much smarter. It will only scroll
  if the selected result isn't fully visible. If the result is already
  entirely within the visible area of the viewport, no scrolling will occur.

* A pre-existing `listNode` may now be specified at initialization time.

* Added `subWordMatch` filters and highlighters. [Contributed by Tobias
  Schultze]

* The `this` object now refers to the current AutoComplete instance instead of
  the window in list locators, text locators, filters, formatters,
  highlighters, and requestTemplate functions.

* Added an `originEvent` property to the event facade of `select` events. It
  contains an event facade of the DOM event that triggered the selection if
  the selection was triggered by a DOM event.

* Small performance improvement for filters operating on empty query strings.
  [Ticket #2529949]

* Result list alignment is now updated both when results change and when
  the window is resized instead of only when the list becomes visible. This
  makes right-aligned lists with dynamic widths less awkward.

* Fixed a bug that prevented CSS-based z-index values from taking effect on
  the AutoComplete list and required the z-index to be set via JS. The
  `.yui3-aclist` class now provides a default z-index of 1, and this can be
  overridden with custom CSS. Specifying a `zIndex` attribute value via JS
  no longer has any effect.

* Fixed a bug that caused the IE6 iframe shim under the AutoComplete list to
  be sized incorrectly the first time the list was displayed.

* Fixed a bug in which the `requestTemplate` would sometimes be used as the
  query instead of being appended to the source URL. This affected XHR and
  JSONP sources that used both a `{query}` placeholder in the source string
  and a custom `requestTemplate` value. [Ticket #2529895]

* Fixed a bug that caused the `requestTemplate` function to be called twice
  for an XHR request instead of just once.

* Fixed a bug in which JSONP, XHR, and YQL requests were cached solely based
  on the query rather than on the complete request. This could result in
  cache collisions when two requests with the same query but different
  parameters (provided by a requestTemplate) were made. [Ticket #2530410]

* Fixed a bug that caused the `&` character to be treated as an up arrow
  key in Firefox. [Ticket #2530455]

* Removed the "beta" label. Hooray!


3.3.0
-----

* Initial release.
