3.0.0

No Changes

3.0.0 beta 1

* PluginHost moved down to Base.

* Render event args added to event facade instead of being passed
  across separately (e.parentNode).

* "hasFocus" attribute renamed to "focused"

* "focused" attribute is read only

* "focused" attribute is set via:
   - user interaction
   - the "focus" and "blur" methods

* Only one DOM focus event handler is used now (two for WebKit) and it is 
  bound to the widget's ownerDocument.  This allows modal widgets to maintain
  a reference to the element in the document that previously had focus and 
  to be able to restore that focus when the modal widget is hidden.

* "tabIndex" attribute was updated
  - accepts a number or null
  - more documentation
