Widget
======

Widget is the foundation class from which all YUI 3 widgets are derived. 

It provides the following pieces of core functionality:

  * The render lifecycle method, in addition to the init and destroy 
    lifecycle methods provided by Base
  * Abstract rendering methods to support a consistent MVC structure across
    widgets
  * A common set of base widget attributes
  * Consistent class-name generation support
  * Plugin support
