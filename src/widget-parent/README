Widget-Parent is an extension designed to be used with Base.build, to create
widget classes which can manage nested child widgets.

For example, it could be used to create Menu widgets, which contain MenuItem 
widgets, or Tree widgets, which contain TreeNode widgets.

3.3.0

* Changed instanceof to Y.instanceOf, to prevent leaks in IE7
* Renamed "type" in child configuration, to "childType", so that
  children can have a "type" attribute for it's own context
  (A FormElement widget for examplei, with a "type").

  "type" is still supported but deprecated for backward compatibility,
  so it's only used to define a child widget type if "childType" is not
  provided.
* Fixed remove(), to actually remove child from DOM also.
