ValueChange
===========

Provides a synthetic "valueChange" event that fires when the "value"
property of a text input element or textarea changes as the result of a
keystroke, mouse operation, or input method editor (IME) input event.

The "valueChange" event provides more reliable change notifications than
native events like "oninput" and "textInput", particularly with changes that
result from multiple-keystroke IME input.
