ValueChange
===========

Provides a synthetic `valueChange` event that fires when the `value`
property of a text input element or textarea changes as the result of a
keystroke, mouse operation, or input method editor (IME) input event.

The `valueChange` event provides more reliable input notifications than
native events like `oninput` and `textInput`, particularly with changes that
result from multiple-keystroke IME input.


Change History
--------------

3.3.0

  * Focus is now used (in addition to keyboard and mouse events) as a sign that
    we should begin polling for value changes. [Ticket #2529294]
  * If the value changes while an element is not focused, that change will no
    longer be reported the next time polling is started (since it couldn't have
    been user input).

3.2.0

  * Module renamed to `event-valuechange` and refactored to be a true synthetic
    event.
  * The `value` and `oldValue` event facade properties were renamed to `newVal`
    and `prevVal` respectively, for consistency with other change event facades
    throughout the library.
  * Performance improvements.

3.1.2

  * No changes.

3.1.1

  * No changes.

3.1.0

  * Initial release as `value-change`.
