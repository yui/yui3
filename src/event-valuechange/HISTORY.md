ValueChange Change History
==========================

3.4.1
-----

  * No changes.


3.4.0
-----

  * No changes.


3.3.0
-----

  * Focus is now used (in addition to keyboard and mouse events) as a sign that
    we should begin polling for value changes. [Ticket #2529294]

  * If the value changes while an element is not focused, that change will no
    longer be reported the next time polling is started (since it couldn't have
    been user input).


3.2.0
-----

  * Module renamed to `event-valuechange` and refactored to be a true synthetic
    event.

  * The `value` and `oldValue` event facade properties were renamed to `newVal`
    and `prevVal` respectively, for consistency with other change event facades
    throughout the library.

  * Performance improvements.


3.1.2
-----

  * No changes.


3.1.1
-----

  * No changes.


3.1.0
-----

  * Initial release as `value-change`.
