The YUI Global
    Provides core YUI functionality, including module registration and consumption utils,
    language/array/object utilities, browser detection, a setTimout/setInterval wrapper,
    and dynamic loading of script and css files.

    The yui module is a rollup of the following modules:
        yui-base
        get

3.next
* Added the ability to define a global configuration object (YUI_config).
* Added Object.some().

3.0.0

* Extracted the loader from the seed file.  Instead, if loader not included, 'get' is included,
  and dependencies are missing, the loader will be fetched before continuing.
* User agent detection is more granular.  e.g., FireFox 3.5 reports gecko 1.91 rather than 1.9.
* Fixed UA.os.
* Added additional mobile device detection.
* Get utility attribute cleanup before purging nodes.
* cached accepts a parameter to refresh a cached value.
* yui-log and yui-later are now optional modules that are included with yui.js.
* queue-base is no longer a submodule of queue -- it is part of yui-base.
* All YUI submodules end up in the yui build directory.
* Dynamic loading can be disabled by setting the 'bootstrap' config to false.

3.0.0 beta 1

    Core:
    - Y.fail has been renamed to Y.error so that Y.fail can be used for the assertion
      engine.
    - Y.stamp now accepts a readOnly parameter to be used when you are only interested
      in reading an existing guid rather than creating a new one.
    - Y.stamp defends against stamping items that can't be stamped.
    - Added to Object: values(), hasKey(), hasValue(), size(), getValue, setValue
      (the latter are for manipulating nested values)
    - Y.use calls are queued during dynamic loading.
    - Added Y.cached for function memoizing
    - added numericSort to Array
    - The yui:log event broadcasts globally.

    Lang: 
    - Added Lang.type (typeof abstraction), and refactored some 'is' methods to use it.

    Get:
    - Accepts an attribute collection config to apply to inserted nodes.
    - id attributes are globally unique
    - Now accepts purgethreshold as a config option.  This will set the number of transactions

    - lots of new module metadata
