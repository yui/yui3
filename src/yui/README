The YUI Global
    Provides core YUI functionality, including module registration and consumption utils,
    language/array/object utilities, browser detection, a setTimout/setInterval wrapper,
    and dynamic loading of script and css files.

    The yui module is a rollup of the following modules:
        yui-base
        get
        loader
        queue-base

3.0.0 beta 1

    Core:
    - Y.fail has been renamed to Y.error so that Y.fail can be used for the assertion
      engine.
    - Y.stamp now accepts a readOnly parameter to be used when you are only interested
      in reading an existing guid rather than creating a new one.
    - Y.stamp defends against stamping items that can't be stamped.
    - Added to Object: values(), hasKey(), hasValue(), size(), getValue, setValue
      (the latter are for manipulating nested values)
    - Y.use calls are queued during dynamic loading.
    - Added Y.cached for function memoizing
    - added numericSort to Array
    - The yui:log event broadcasts globally.

    Lang: 
    - Added Lang.type (typeof abstraction), and refactored some 'is' methods to use it.

    Get:
    - Accepts an attribute collection config to apply to inserted nodes.
    - id attributes are globally unique
    - Now accepts purgethreshold as a config option.  This will set the number of transactions
      required before auto removing nodes from previous transactions (default is 20)

    Loader:
    - yuitest renamed to test, now requires collection
    - lots of new module metadata
    - added onCSS
