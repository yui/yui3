/**
Returns a wrapper for a function which caches the return value of that function,
keyed off of the combined string representation of the argument values provided
when the wrapper is called.

Calling this function again with the same arguments will return the cached value
rather than executing the wrapped function.

Note that since the cache is keyed off of the string representation of arguments
passed to the wrapper function, arguments that aren't strings and don't provide
a meaningful `toString()` method may result in unexpected caching behavior. For
example, the objects `{}` and `{foo: 'bar'}` would both be converted to the
string `[object Object]` when used as a cache key.

@method cached
@param {Function} source The function to memoize.
@param {Object} [cache={}] Object in which to store cached values. You may seed
  this object with pre-existing cached values if desired.
@param {any} [refetch] If supplied, this value is compared with the cached value
  using a `==` comparison. If the values are equal, the wrapped function is
  executed again even though a cached value exists.
@return {Function} Wrapped function.

It is _not_ recommended to hold references to the `window.location` object

its methods are being called. This is because of a nasty bug/issue that exists
in both Safari and MobileSafari browsers:
[WebKit Bug 34679](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=34679).

Mixes _supplier_'s properties into _receiver_.

Properties on _receiver_ or _receiver_'s prototype will not be overwritten or
shadowed unless the _overwrite_ parameter is `true`, and will not be merged
unless the _merge_ parameter is `true`.

In the default mode (0), only properties the supplier owns are copied (prototype
properties are not copied). The following copying modes are available:

  * `0`: _Default_. Object to object.
  * `1`: Prototype to prototype.
  * `2`: Prototype to prototype and object to object.
  * `3`: Prototype to object.
  * `4`: Object to prototype.

@method mix
@param {Function|Object} receiver The object or function to receive the mixed
  properties.
@param {Function|Object} supplier The object or function supplying the
  properties to be mixed.
@param {Boolean} [overwrite=false] If `true`, properties that already exist
  on the receiver will be overwritten with properties from the supplier.
@param {String[]} [whitelist] An array of property names to copy. If
  specified, only the whitelisted properties will be copied, and all others
  will be ignored.
@param {Number} [mode=0] Mix mode to use. See above for available modes.
@param {Boolean} [merge=false] If `true`, objects and arrays that already
  exist on the receiver will have the corresponding object/array from the
  supplier merged into them, rather than being skipped or overwritten. When
  both _overwrite_ and _merge_ are `true`, _merge_ takes precedence.
@return {Function|Object|YUI} The receiver, or the YUI instance if the
  specified receiver is falsy.
