  * Panel now hosts the a default "close" button which can be included more
    easily then before. This button has advanced styling which will render the

    when it's in the header. [Ticket #2531680]

        var panel = new Y.Panel({
            buttons: ['close']
        });

        // Panel with close button in footer.
        var otherPanel = new Y.Panel({
            buttons: {
                footer: ['close']
            }
