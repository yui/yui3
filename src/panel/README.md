Panel
=====

Panel is a widget that simulates the behavior of an OS window. It is
positionable, stackable, and provides support for the standard module format
layout, with a header, body and footer section. The header and footer sections
can support buttons with specific callback functions. The panel can be modal,
and can be auto-focused or hidden when certain UI interactions occur.

`Panel` is built by extending `Widget` and adding the `WidgetPosition`,
`WidgetStack`, `WidgetPositionAlign`, `WidgetPositionConstrain`, `WidgetStdMod`,
`WidgetModality`, `WidgetAutohide`, and `WidgetButtons` extensions.
