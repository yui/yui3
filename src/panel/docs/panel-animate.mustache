    This example demonstrates how to instantiate a panel and use it in conjunction with the `"transition"` module to create an animated panel.

<h2>Creating an animated panel</h2>

<h3>Setting Up The YUI Instance</h3>

<p>
To create an instance of a Panel on your page, the only module you need to request is the `panel` module. The `panel` module will pull in the `widget`, `widget-stack`, `widget-position`, `widget-position-align`, `widget-position-constrain`, `widget-stdmod`, `widget-buttons`, `widget-modality` and `widget-autohide` extensions it uses.
</p>

<p>
For this example, we also need to use the `transition` module. This module allows us to easily create animations using CSS3 transitions, with a JavaScript timer fallback.
</p>

```javascript
YUI().use('panel', 'transition', function (Y) {
    // We'll write example code here
});
```

<p>
Note, using the `panel` module, will also pull down the default CSS required for panel. The CSS that styles the Panel requires you to have the class `yui3-skin-sam` on a parent element, commonly the `<body>` tag.
</p>

<h3>Instantiating the Panel</h3>

<p>
For this example, we'll instantiate a modal panel, set its visibility to false, and set some CSS properties. The following HTML will be used as the markup for the panel.
</p>

```html
<div id="panelContent">
    <div class="yui3-widget-hd">
        Showing an animated panel
    </div>
    <div class="yui3-widget-bd">
        <p>Making panels animate is easy with the "transition" module!</p>
    </div>
</div>
```

<p>The JavaScript to instantiate the panel is as follows:</p>

```javascript
var panel = new Y.Panel({
    srcNode: '#panelContent',
    width  : 330,
    xy     : [300, -300],
    zIndex : 5,
    modal  : true,
    visible: false,
    render : true,
    buttons: [
        {
            value  : 'Close the panel',
            section: 'footer',
            action : function (e) {
                e.preventDefault();
                hidePanel();
            }
        }
    ]
});
```

<h3>Adding Animation</h3>

<p>
To create the animations, we need to set up transition properties on the panel's `boundingBox`. These properties consist of key/value pairs of CSS properties that we want to alter.
</p>

<p>
We define two methods `showPanel()` and `hidePanel()` that define transitions. We could also use the `visibleChange` event to toggle the animation based on the state. However, the benefit of this method is that it allows us to use callback functions after the `transition` has ended.
</p>


```javascript
function showPanel() {
    panel.show();
    bb.transition({
        duration: 0.5,
        top     : '80px'
    });
}

function hidePanel() {
    bb.transition({
        duration: 0.5,
        top     : '-300px'
    }, function () {
        panel.hide();
    });
}
```

<h3>Adding Buttons to toggle visibility</h3>

<p>
Finally, we create two buttons, one to show the panel and one to hide it.
</p>

<p>
The button to close the panel was specified in the instantiation of the panel. The button to open the panel can be defined as:
</p>

```javascript
// Add Panel show button.
openBtn.on('click', function (e) {
    showPanel();
});
```
