History Manager
    Provides browser history management functionality using a simple
    add/get/replace paradigm. This can be used to ensure that the browser's back
    and forward buttons work as the user expects and to provide bookmarkable
    URLs that return the user to the current application state, even in an Ajax
    application that doesn't perform full-page refreshes.

    The following modules are available:
        history         - Rollup of history-base, history-hash, and
                          history-hash-ie.
        history-base    - Generic history management API (but no storage layer).
        history-hash    - History management using window.location.hash.
        history-hash-ie - Adds IE6/7 back/forward support using an iframe hack.

3.2.0
