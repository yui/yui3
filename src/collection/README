    Provides collection management functionality beyond what's in the YUI core.

  * Array.lastIndexOf now supports the fromIndex parameter as specified in ES5.
  * Improved the performance of Array.filter, Array.map, Array.reduce, and
    Array.unique, especially in browsers without native ES5 array extras.

    of YUI.
