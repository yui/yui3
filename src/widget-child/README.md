Widget Child
============

The Widget-Child extension is designed to be used with Base.build, to create 
widget classes which need to be nested inside Widget-Parent based widgets.

For example, it could be used to create MenuItem widgets, which sit inside Menu 
widgets, or TreeNode widgets which sit inside Tree widgets.
