DataBind
=========

DataBind provides the `Y.DataBind` class to bind attributes to form elements.

The class may be used standalone, or as a class extension.

The three required configurations of DataBind are:

1. `container` - The DOM element that contains the bound inputs. Defaulted from
    Widget's boundingBox if used as an extension for a Widget.
1. `model` - The Attribute source. Defaulted from `this.get('model') || this`
    when used as an extension for a class with Attribute.
1. `fields` - An object map of HTML form field names (the value of the `name`
    attribute) to the attribute. Defaults to a map generated by querying the
    containers subtree for elements with a "data-bind-attr" attribute.

Additional configurations are supported in the `fields` map values when an
object is used as the value, including:
```
fields: {
    fieldNameA: 'attributeNameA',
    fieldNameB: {
        attr: 'attributeNameB',
        getter: function (node) { /* code to get a value from node */ },
        setter: function (node, value) { /* ... to set a value in node */ },
        formatter: function (value) { /* massage value for display in DOM */ },
        parser: function (value) { /* extract raw value from DOM value */ }
    }
}
```

`getter` and `setter` are not commonly needed, as DataBind can get and set
values to common form elements already. `formatter` and `parser` are useful
to translate things like raw floats to formatted currency strings for the UI,
and likewise to extract raw data from formatted strings. They should be used as
a pair.
