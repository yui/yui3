====

The Charts module provides a JavaScript API for visualizing data in a variety of formats across all A-grade browsers. Based on 
device and browser capabilities, Charts leverages SVG, HTML Canvas and VML to render its graphical elements.

The Charts module features a Chart class that allows you to easily create a chart from a set of data. Chart extends Widget and 
includes configurable attributes that enable you to customize a Chart. Currently, the Chart widget can be used to create different 
variations and combinations of line, marker, area, spline, column, bar and pie charts.
