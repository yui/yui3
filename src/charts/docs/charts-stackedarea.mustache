<h3>This example shows how to create a Stacked Area Chart that fires planar events.</h3>


<p>By default, Charts fires mouse events based on marker interaction. This is not always preferable. You may have a chart without markers or you may want to display data
about all markers intersecting a plane. The `interactionType` attribute allows you to do this. 
In this example, setting stacked area chart's `interactionType` attribute to "planar" allows the tooltip to display all relevant data on a vertical plane.</p>
