3.0.0
* Cleaned up the way headerContent, bodyContent, footerContent are configured,
  so that the actual stored value is always accurate, without the need for a 
  getter which talks to the DOM directly.

* Recreate sections from TEMPLATE string for each instance, instead of
  cloning a class level cached Node instance, so that ownerDocument
  can be set to match the content box.

* Replaced use of innerHTML for progressive enhancement use case with 
  document fragment when parsing and then setting headerContent, bodyContent,
  footerContent in HTML_PARSER impl, to maintain event listeners etc.
