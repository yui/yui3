Queue
    The Queue module in its simplest form is just that: a simple queuing mechanism.  Items added to the Queue are removed via next().  With all additional functionality included, it allows you to create a chain of function callbacks executed in order via setTimeout.  It also supports timeout chained iterations for each item in the Queue.

    There are three submodules available for Queue:
    * queue-base - a simple queue with add(..) and next()
    * queue-promote - adds promote(c) and delete(c) to queue-base
    * queue-run - Adds a new fully featured queue class AsyncQueue with autorun
                  asynchronous callback execution, timeout chaining, event
                  broadcasting

    See the user guide and API docs for more detail.
