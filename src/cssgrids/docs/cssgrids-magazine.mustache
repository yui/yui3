	<p>The HTML for this example uses YUI3 Responsive Grids syntax to look great on different screen sizes (resize this page or view it on a smartphone). On larger screens, there are three columns. However, if viewed on a screen that is smaller than 767px, the columns stack vertically. The right-most column, which shows a stack of content on larger widths, changes to show a grid on smaller widths.</p>
