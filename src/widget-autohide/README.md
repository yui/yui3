Widget Autohide
===============

`WidgetAutohide` is a widget-level extension that provides the ability to hide
the widget (through the `hide()` method) when certain UI interactions occur, or
certain events are fired. It provides the `hideOn` attribute that  can be
configured by a widget subclass implementing this extension.
