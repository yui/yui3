Widget Position Constrain
=========================

An extension, which can be used with Base.build to add the ability to constrain 
XY positioning for a widget to the viewport, or to another node. Also provides 
"preventOverlap" support, to prevent the widget from overlapping the node to 
which it is aligned (when using widget-position-align).
