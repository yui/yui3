The Slider widget
    The Slider widget creates an input UI involving a draggable thumb, representing a value, sliding along a rail, representing the finite value range.

3.0.0 beta1
    * renamed the valueSet custom event to positionThumb and rejiggered the
      logic of the default function and support methods.
    * renamed _defSyncUI to _defSyncFn for library nomenclature consistency
    * Added protected _convertValueToOffset to help position the thumb
    * Set bubble: false on the DD.Drag instance
    * Created a ConsoleFilters plugin to restore the filter checkboxes familiar
      to yui2 users. myConsole.plug(Y.Plugin.ConsoleFilters);
    * Added collapse/expand button to header and changed input[type=button]s to
      button elements
    * silence the logging subsystem during the print cycle
    * major markup and skin css overhaul
    * added support for setting height and width in configuration
    * logLevel filtering now only applies to messages with info|warn|error.
      All other messages pass through.
    * static Console.LOG_LEVEL_INFO etc are now strings
    * added logSource attribute to support a single Console instance listening
      to all YUI instance log statements { logSource: Y.Global }
    * added destructor
    * Renamed _timeout to _printLoop and _clearTimeout to _cancelPrintLoop
    * refactored printLogEntry to call new _createEntry(meta). _addToConsole
      subsumed into printLogEntry.  _createEntry returns an HTML string.
    * print loop scheduled on render to display any previously buffered entries
    * print loop only scheduled if the Console has been rendered
    * entries added to Console via DocumentFragment and Node instance creation
      avoided for performance
    * buffer is spliced at the beginning of a print loop to limit entries that
      would be removed by consoleLimit anyway
