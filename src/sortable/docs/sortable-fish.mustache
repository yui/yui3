<div class="intro">
<p>This example has 2 sortable lists, each with floated nodes. 
The lists are outer joined together. 
The small fish on the left
can move into the groups on the right, and become sortable (and larger). 
However, the items in the groups on the right 
<strong>cannot</strong> move back into the list of small fish.</p>

<p><strong>Note: When using an outer or inner joined list, you must pick a moveType of 'move' or 'copy', the default 'swap' won't give you the results you expect.</strong></p>
<p>This example assumes that you have seen the Multiple Sortable Lists - Full Join example and continues from there.</p>
