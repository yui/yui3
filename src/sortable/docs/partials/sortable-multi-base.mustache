<h3>Setting Up the List</h3>
<p>First we need to create the HTML structure for the lists. Since `Sortable` uses `Y.DD.Delegate`, we need to set up the delegation containers (`#list1, #lists2`) and the list items (`li`).</p>

```
{{>sortable-multi-source-html}}
```

<p>Now we give the lists some CSS to make them visible.</p>

```
{{>sortable-multi-source-css}}
```

<h3>Setting Up the YUI Instance</h3>
<p>Now we need to create our YUI instance and tell it to load the `sortable` module.</p>
<p>In this example we are also going to attach a `DD` plugin to the `Sortable` instances.</p>

```
YUI().use('dd-constrain', 'sortable'
```

<h3>Making the Lists Draggable</h3>
<p>Now that we have a YUI instance with the `sortable` module, we need to instantiate a `Sortable` instance on each of the lists.</p>

```
{{>sortable-multi-source-js-pre}}
{{>sortable-multi-source-js-post}}
```

<h3>Applying a DD Plugin</h3>
<p>Since `Sortable` uses `DD.Delegate`, there is a dd instance available after instantiation.</p>
<p>The `DD.Delegate` reference is found on the `.delegate` property of the `Sortable`.
This `DD.Delegate` instance has a `DD.Drag` instance bound to the `dd` property on the `DD.Delegate`
</p>

```
{{>sortable-multi-source-js-connect}}
```
<p>Applying the `Plugin.DDConstrained` to the `Sortable` instance.</p>

```
{{>sortable-multi-source-js-pre}}
{{>sortable-multi-source-js-connect}}
{{>sortable-multi-source-js-post}}
```
