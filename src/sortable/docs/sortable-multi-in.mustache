<div class="intro">
<p>This example makes multiple sortable lists that are inner joined together. In the example below you will see 2 lists. Both lists are sortable, but List #2 can move its items into List #1 and they become sortable. However, List #1 <strong>can not</strong> move its items into List #2.</p>
</div>

<div class="example">
    {{>sortable-multi-in-source}}
</div>

<p><strong>Note: When using an outer or inner joined list, you must pick a moveType of 'move' or 'copy', the default 'swap' won't give you the results you expect.</strong></p>
<p>This example assumes that you have seen the Multiple Sortable Lists - Full Join example and continues from there.</p>
