<div class="intro">
<p>This example makes multiple sortable lists that are outer joined together. In the example below you will see 2 lists.
Both lists are sortable, but List #1 can move its items into List #2 and they become sortable. However, List #2 <strong>can not</strong> move its items into List #1.</p>
</div>

<div class="example">
    <style>
    {{>sortable-multi-source-css}}
    {{>sortable-indent-css}}
    {{>sortable-arrows-css}}
    </style>
    
    {{>sortable-multi-source-indent-html}}
    {{>sortable-arrows}}
    
    <script>
    {{>sortable-multi-out-source-js}}
    </script>
</div>

<p><strong>Note: When using an outer or inner joined list, you must pick a moveType of 'move' or 'copy', the default 'swap' won't give you the results you expect.</strong></p>
<p>This example assumes that you have seen the Multiple Sortable Lists - Full Join example and continues from there.</p>
