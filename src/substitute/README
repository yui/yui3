YUI substitute
    A string templating utility

3.3.0
  * No change

3.2.0
    * No change to this utility, but Y.Lang.sub was added to the YUI core.  This
      is a lightweight version of the substitute utility that follows the same
      templating syntax, but lacks recursive replacements, object dumping, and
      string formatting.  The advantage is that it is very small, and available
      in the YUI core -- perhaps the regular expression implementation will be
      faster than the string manipulation that happens in substitute in some
      situations.

3.1.1
    * No change

3.1.0
  * substitute has a 'recurse' option to support nested templates (the previous
    default behavior).  Normal operation is now a single level substitution which
    is tolerant of brackets in the replacement string.
