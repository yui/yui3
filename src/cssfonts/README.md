CSS Fonts Utility
===============

Note: The files "fonts.css" and "fonts-context.css" are deprecated, use "cssfonts.css" and
"cssfonts-context.css" instead.

The foundational CSS Fonts provides cross-browser 
typographical normalization and control while still 
allowing users to choose and adjust their font size. 
Both Standards and Quirks modes are supported in A-grade browsers.
