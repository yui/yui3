DOM Utility
===============

The DOM Utility is a set of helper functions for Node. Normally this
functionality should be accessed via Node, rather than coding directly
to the DOM api.

The following modules are available:

  * `dom`: Rollup of `dom-base`, `dom-screen`, and `dom-style`.
  * `dom-base`: Provides the basic support for querying, creating, and using
    DOM nodes.
  * `dom-screen`: Provides methods for positioning elements, measuring the
    document and viewport, and working with regions. 
  * `dom-style`: Adds setStyle()/getStyle() and getComputedStyle() methods
    for working with style properties.
