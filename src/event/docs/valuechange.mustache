<div class="intro">
    <p>The `event-valuechange` module adds a "valueChange" event that fires
    when the `value` property of a text input element or textarea changes as
    the result of a keystroke, mouse operation, or input method editor (IME)
    input event.</p>
</div>

<h2>What's the problem?</h2>

<p>The input related events provided by browsers don't cleanly address the
variety of ways users can modify an &lt;input&gt; or &lt;textarea&gt;'s
`value`.  For example, users might change an input value by</p>

<ol>
    <li>typing a simple character</li>
    <li>typing a multi-stroke character</li>
    <li>
        using an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input_method">Input
        Method Editor</a>
    </li>
    <li>cutting from or pasting into the value with `ctrl+X` or `cmd+V`</li>
    <li>cutting or pasting with a keyboard summoned context menu</li>
    <li>cutting or pasting from the right-click context menu.</li>
</ol>

<p>The ideal change event would fire when the value becomes <em>something it
wasn't a moment ago</em>.</p>

<p>The `valueChange` event provides more reliable input notifications than
native events like `oninput` and `textInput`, particularly with changes that
result from multiple-keystroke IME input.</p>

```
commentTextarea.on('valueChange', updateLivePreview);
```

<h2>How it works</h2>

<p>`valueChange` subscriptions monitor the input's value using a variety of
mechanisms including subscriptions to `blur` and various keyboard events, and a
poll to catch the stragglers.  It seems like a lot of work, but it's the only
way to be sure.</p>

<p>The polling is only active when the input is focused, so the performance of your app should not be impacted.</p>

<h2>Caveats</h2>

<ol>
    <li>`valueChange` does not (yet) support delegation</li>
    <li>
        `valueChange` only supports subscription on text &lt;input&gt;s and
        &lt;textarea&gt;s, though no steps are taken to ensure the subscribed
        node is one of these.  If you subscribe to a different type of node,
        and stuff breaks, you were warned.
    </li>
    <li>
        `valueChange` does not capture `value` updates done in JavaScript
        <em>unless the input is currently focused</em>.
        `node.set('value', 'will probably not trigger valueChange');`
    </li>
</ol>
