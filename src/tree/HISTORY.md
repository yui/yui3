Tree Change History
===================

@VERSION@
-----

* Fixed: The number returned by `Tree#size()` didn't include the root node.
  [Ryan Grove]

3.9.1
-----

* Added a `src` option to all methods that trigger events. This value is passed
  along to the event facade of the resulting event, and can be used to
  distinguish between changes caused by different sources (such as
  user-initiated changes vs. programmatic changes). [Ryan Grove]


3.9.0
-----

* Initial release. [Ryan Grove]
