The Console tool
    The Console tool creates a cross browser display to read log messages emitted by the YUI logging subsystem.

3.0.0 beta 1
    * logSource attribute added to configure listening for events from a
      specific target.  Also useful for subscribing to all log events across
      multiple YUI instances.
    * Lowered consoleLimit default to 300
    * printLimit attribute added to limit the number of entries from the buffer
      to output in a given printBuffer call
    * printBuffer(max) argument added to limit the number of entries to print
      in this cycle
    * Changed from setTimeout to setInterval to chunk DOM output
    * logLevel constants changed to strings and categories outside info, warn,
      and error are not treated as info
    * CSS updates
    * Support for height and width attribute configuration
    * Changed <input type="button"> to <button type="button">
    * Added Collapse/Expand
    * Entry addition and removal now occurs off DOM
    * Entry removal checks that the target node is present before removing it
