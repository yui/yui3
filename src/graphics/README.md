Graphics
====

The Graphics module provides a JavaScript API for creating shapes in a variety of formats across all A-grade browsers. Based on device and
browser capabilities, Graphics leverages SVG, HTML Canvas and VML to render its graphical elements.

The Graphics module features a Graphic class that allows you to easily create and manage shapes. Currently, a Graphic instance can be used to
create predifined shapes and free-form polygons with fill and stroke properties.
