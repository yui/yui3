<h2>The Radial Gradient Tool</h2>

<p>The Interactive Control modifies the gradient fill.
As you drag the center dot, or drag or resize the outer disc,
the fill preview updates. You can also see the fill's 
property values update. The center color and outer color can also be changed.
These are the colors of the gradient stops.
Click the "Get Code Snippet" button. This code can be copied and pasted 
into a graphics instance to reproduce the gradient fill in your code.
</p>


<h2>Using the Generated Code</h2>
<p>When you click the "Get Code Snippet" button, generated code is placed
in the text area control. The generated code assumes you will have a separate
page to paste it into. This separate page must contain the following code: 
A graphics container such as this,</p>
```
<div id="mygraphiccontainer"></div>
```
<p>CSS such as this,</p>
```
#mygraphiccontainer {
    position: relative;
    width: 400px;
    height: 400px;
}
```
and a YUI instance containing a `Graphics` object such as this.
```
YUI().use('graphics', function (Y) {

    var mygraphic = new Y.Graphic({render:"#mygraphiccontainer"});
    // generated code from the radial gradient tool goes here
    
});
```
<p>The tool generates paste-able code for an `addShape` method that will
create and render an ellipse. You can change this after it's pasted into 
your code.</p>
