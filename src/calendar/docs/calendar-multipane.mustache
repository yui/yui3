This example demonstrates how to instantiate a Calendar, switch its template to a double-pane, and create custom renderers for its header and certain cells (based on rules), as well as turn on multiple date selection and disable certain dates from being selected.
</p>

<p>
Try clicking on the "Toggle showing the next month" and "Toggle showing the previous month" to change the initial settings for showing the previous and next months' dates. You can also select dates in the calendar and see selected date on the right, reported via a `selectionChange` event, and formatted using `Datatype` utility.
