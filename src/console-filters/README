The ConsoleFilters plugin
    The ConsoleFilters plugin adds per-category and per-source display filtering to the Console.  Two groups of checkboxes are added to the Console footer, one for known categories and the other for known sources.  Only messages with a checked category or source will display in the Console.  Unlike other means of filtering, rechecking a checkbox will return previously filtered messages.
