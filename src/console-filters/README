The ConsoleFilters plugin
    The ConsoleFilters plugin adds per-category and per-source display
    filtering to the Console.  Two groups of checkboxes are added to the
    Console footer, one for known categories and the other for known sources.
    Only messages with a checked category or source will display in the
    Console.  Unlike other means of filtering, rechecking a checkbox will
    return previously filtered messages.
