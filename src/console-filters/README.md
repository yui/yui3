ConsoleFilters Plugin
=====================

Adds per-category and per-source display filtering to the `Console`. Two groups
of checkboxes are added to the Console footer, one for known categories and the
other for known sources. Only messages with a checked category or source will
display in the Console. Unlike other means of filtering, rechecking a checkbox
will return previously filtered messages.
