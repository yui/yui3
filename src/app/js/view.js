    Hash of CSS selectors mapped to events to delegate to elements matching
    those selectors.

    CSS selectors are relative to the `container` element. Events are attached
    to the container, and delegation is used so that subscribers are only
    notified of events that occur on elements inside the container that match
    the specified selectors. This allows the container's contents to be re-
    rendered as needed without losing event subscriptions.

    Event handlers can be specified either as functions or as strings that map
    to function names on this view instance or its prototype.

    The `this` object in event handlers will refer to this view instance. If
    you'd prefer `this` to be something else, use `Y.bind()` to bind a custom
    `this` object.

    @example

        var view = new Y.View({
            events: {
                // Call `this.toggle()` whenever the element with the id
                // "toggle-button" is clicked.
                '#toggle-button': {click: 'toggle'},

                // Call `this.hoverOn()` when the mouse moves over any element
                // with the "hoverable" class, and `this.hoverOff()` when the
                // mouse moves out of any element with the "hoverable" class.
                '.hoverable': {
                    mouseover: 'hoverOn',
                    mouseout : 'hoverOff'
                }

    Since there's no default renderer, you're free to render your view however
    you see fit, whether that means manipulating the DOM directly, dumping
    strings into `innerHTML`, or using a template language of some kind.

    For basic templating needs, `Y.Node.create()` and `Y.Lang.sub()` may
    suffice, but there are no restrictions on what tools or techniques you can
    use to render your view. All you need to do is append something to the
    container element at some point, and optionally append the container
    to the DOM if it's not there already.

        Container node into which this view's content will be rendered.

        The container node serves as the host for all DOM events attached by the
        view. Delegation is used to handle events on children of the container,
        allowing the container's contents to be re-rendered at any time without
        losing event subscriptions.

        The default container is a `<div>` Node, but you can override this in
        a subclass, or by passing in a custom `container` config value at
        instantiation time.

        When `container` is overridden by a subclass or passed as a config
        option at instantiation time, it may be provided as a selector string, a
        DOM element, or a `Y.Node` instance. During initialization, this view's
        `create()` method will be called to convert the container into a
        `Y.Node` instance if it isn't one already.

        The container is not added to the page automatically. This allows you to
        have full control over how and when your view is actually rendered to
        the page.
