  * Added WidgetConstrain support to the packaged Overlay class.

3.0.0
-----

  * Initial release.

  * Modified progressive enhancement use case, to use Document Fragments instead
    of `innerHTML` to preserve event listeners.

  * Fixed use of `centered`, `x` and `y` in the constructor. These all needed
    `lazyAdd` configuration since they had setters which modified other
    attribute state.
