Overlay
=======

Overlay is a positionable and stackable widget, which also 
provides support for the standard module format layout, 
with a header, body and footer section. 

The overlay is built by extending Widget and adding the 
WidgetPosition, WidgetStack, WidgetPositionAlign, 
WidgetPositionConstrain and WidgetStdMod extensions.
