Overlay
=======

Overlay is a positionable and stackable widget, which also
provides support for the standard module format layout,
with a header, body and footer section.

The overlay is built by extending Widget and adding the
WidgetPosition, WidgetStack, WidgetPositionAlign,
WidgetPositionConstrain and WidgetStdMod extensions.
