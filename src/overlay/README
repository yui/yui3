Overlay is a positionable and stackable widget, which also 
provides support for the standard module format layout, 
with a header, body and footer section. 

The overlay is built by extending Widget and adding the 
WidgetPosition, WidgetStack, WidgetPositionAlign, 
WidgetPositionConstrain and WidgetStdMod extensions.

No changes

3.1.0

* Added WidgetConstrain support to the packaged Overlay class.

* Fixed centering when content is set in constructor.

3.0.0

* Modified progressive enhancement use case, to use document
  fragments instead of innerHTML to preserve event listeners.

* Fixed use of centered, x and y in the constructor. These all
  needed 'lazyAdd' configuration since they had setters which 
  modified other attribute state.
