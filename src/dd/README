**** version 3.2.0 ****

**IMPORTANT** dd-plugin and dd-plugin-drop are no longer bundled with the dd module. They are
now official plugins and need to be "used" on their own.

Moved to new Gesture support. DD now works off both mouse events and touch events natively with
the "drag-gestures" plugin that is conditionally loaded when touch events are found on the page.

**** version 3.0.0 Beta1 ****

Added a plugin to support Window and Node based scrolling

    var dd = new Y.DD.Drag({
        node: '#drag'
    }).plug(Y.plugin.DDWinScroll);

    var dd = new Y.DD.Drag({
        node: '#drag'
    }).plug(Y.plugin.DDNodeScroll, {
        node: '#some-parent-with-scroll'
    });

Proxy and Constrained were moved to the plugin modal, there are some syntax changes:

PR2 - Proxy:
    var dd = new Y.DD.Drag({
        node: '#drag',
        proxy: true,
        moveOnEnd: false
    });

Current - Proxy:
    var dd = new Y.DD.Drag({
        node: '#drag'
    }).plug(Y.plugin.DDProxy, {
        moveOnEnd: false
    });

PR2 - Constrained:
    var dd = new Y.DD.Drag({
        node: '#drag',
        constrain2node: '#wrap'
    });

Current - Constrained:
    var dd = new Y.DD.Drag({
        node: '#drag'
    }).plug(Y.plugin.DDConstrained, {
        constrain2node: '#wrap'
    });

Converted Everything to use setXY now that FF2 is not supported.
Performance tweaks to dragging over a target.
