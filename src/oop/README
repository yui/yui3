  * bind() now adds the arguments supplied to bind before the
    arguments supplied when the function is executed.  Added
    rbind to provide the old functionality (arguments supplied
    to bind are appended to the arguments collection supplied
    to the function when executed).

  * bind() supports a string representing a function on the
    context object in order to allow overriding methods on
    superclasses that are bound to a function displaced by
    aop.
