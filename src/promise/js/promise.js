/**
A promise represents a value that may not yet be available. Promises allow
you to chain asynchronous operations, write synchronous looking code and
handle errors throughout the process.

This constructor takes a function as a parameter where you can insert the logic
that fulfills or rejects this promise. The fulfillment value and the rejection
reason can be any JavaScript value. It's encouraged that rejection reasons be
error objects

<pre><code>
var fulfilled = new Y.Promise(function (fulfill) {
    fulfill('I am a fulfilled promise');
});

var rejected = new Y.Promise(function (fulfill, reject) {
    reject(new Error('I am a rejected promise'));
});
</code></pre>

@class Promise
@constructor
@param {Function} fn A function where to insert the logic that resolves this
        promise. Receives `fulfill` and `reject` functions as parameters.
        This function is called synchronously.

    a promise, and `functionB` and `functionC` _may_ return promises.
