3.0.0 beta1

* Config argument for init event now merged into the event facade, 
  instead of being passed separately (available as e.cfg).
  
* Removed Base.create. On review considered to be overkill.

* Moved PluginHost down from Widget to Base, since utils and 
  Node will also support Plugins.
  
* PluginHost.plug and unplug now accept the plugin class as arguments.
  [ plug(pluginClass, cfg) and unplug(pluginClass) ]

3.0.0PR1 - Initial release

Module Name: "base"
Documentation: http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/base

Base is designed to be a low level class from which other attribute 
and event target based classes in the YUI library can be derived. 
It provides a standard template for creating attribute based objects 
across the library and provides a consistent init() and destroy() 
sequence, by chaining initialization (initializer) and destruction 
(destructor) methods for the class hierarcy.
