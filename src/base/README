3.0.0PR1 - Initial release

Module Name: "base"
Documentation: http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/base

Base is designed to be a low level class from which other attribute 
and event target based classes in the YUI library can be derived. 
It provides a standard template for creating attribute based objects 
across the library and provides a consistent init() and destroy() 
sequence, by chaining initialization (initializer) and destruction 
(destructor) methods for the class hierarcy.
