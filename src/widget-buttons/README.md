WidgetButtons
=============

A widget-level extension that provides the ability to add buttons to the header
and footer sections of a `Widget` that uses the `WidgetStdMod` extension.

Each button can be configured to execute a callback function when clicked.
`WidgetButtons` reveals the `buttons` attribute that can be configured by a
`Widget` subclass using this extension.
