Welcome to YUI 3.

The YUI Library is a set of utilities and controls, written in JavaScript,
for building richly interactive web applications using techniques such 
as DOM scripting, DHTML and AJAX.  It is available under a BSD license 
and is free for all uses.  YUI 3 is the next generation implementation of
the YUI Library that is leveraged for the development of many Yahoo! sites 
including the Yahoo! homepage.

This is the active working source tree for the YUI 3 codeline.  It contains 
work in progress towards the next YUI 3 library release.  Additions and
changes to this repository may undergo modifications ahead of the next official
YUI 3 release.  Therefore, we encourage you to use source in this tree for
evaluation purposes in order to test recent fixes to your bug reports as well
as evaluate and provide feedback on new functionality being added for the 
next release.  Please refer to the Latest Production Release link above
if you are looking for the latest fully qualified version of the YUI 3 library 
recommended for production code. 

The source tree for YUI includes the following directories:

* api: Generated API docs for the entire library in HTML format.  These
     documents are build using YUI Doc from the contents of the src
     directory.
* build: Generated/built YUI files.  The built files are generated from 
     the contents of the src directory.  Files are provided in full,
     commented form (suitable for debugging) and in minified form 
     (suitable for deployment and use).
* sandbox: The sandbox directory contains works-in-progress, including
     unreleased future components, as well as experimental and/or
     demonstration code created by library authors.
* src: This directory contains the source code (JavaScript, CSS, image
     assets, ActionScript files) for the library. src also contains (or
     will contain) all module-specific documentation, tests and examples.
     All modifications to the library and its documentation should take 
     place in this directory.

     The src directory also contains build.xml files, which can be 
     used to build individual modules using the YUI component build 
     tool. The YUI component build tool is part of the YUI "builder" 
     project, also available on GitHub:

         http://github.com/yui/builder

     The README in the componentbuild directory of the builder project
     covers installation and use of the build tool.

Code found in the development head is always a work in progress and
should be treated as experimental.
