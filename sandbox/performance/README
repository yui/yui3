YUI Performance Testing Framework
====================================

GETTING STARTED

  To run the framework, you'll need a recent version of Node.js (it was tested
  with v0.1.98).

  Rename conf/config.sample.json to config.json and edit it to your liking, then
  execute perf-server.js to start the server. Browse to http://localhost:3000/
  (or whatever hostname and port you configured) to view the tests.


ADDING TESTS

  Tests live in public/tests. See the README there and follow the existing
  examples to implement your own tests.


COMPARING MULTIPLE YUI VERSIONS

  In config.json, you'll see a "roots" key. This is a name/value mapping of
  arbitrary root names to actual YUI source roots. The sample config includes
  root mappings for YUI 3 local and YUI 3.1.1, and assumes you have the
  necessary code checked out at ../../ and ../../../yui3-3.1.1/ respectively.

  To test against even more YUI versions, or any other JavaScript code, just add
  more roots.

  Each root maps to a ComboHandler URL which you can use to load static
  resources relative to that root, like so:

    http://localhost:3000/combo/yui3-local?build/yui/yui-min.js&build/oop/oop-min.js
    http://localhost:3000/combo/yui3-3.1.1?build/yui/yui-min.js&build/oop/oop-min.js

  You can also configure the YUI 3 Loader to combine resources using these URLs:

    YUI({
      comboBase: '/combo/yui3-local?',
      combine: true,
      root: 'build/'
    }).use( ... , function (Y) {
      ...
    }


QUESTIONS & PROBLEMS

  This is all still a work in progress, so it changes frequently. Sorry about
  that. If you have any questions or run into problems, feel free to ping me
