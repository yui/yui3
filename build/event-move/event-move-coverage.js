/**
 * Sets up a "gesturemovestart" event, that is fired on touch devices in response to a single finger "touchstart",
 * and on mouse based devices in response to a "mousedown". The subscriber can specify the minimum time
 * and distance thresholds which should be crossed before the "gesturemovestart" is fired and for the mouse,
 * which button should initiate a "gesturemovestart". This event can also be listened for using node.delegate().
 * 
 * <p>It is recommended that you use Y.bind to set up context and additional arguments for your event handler,
 * however if you want to pass the context and arguments as additional signature arguments to on/delegate, 
 * you need to provide a null value for the configuration object, e.g: <code>node.on("gesturemovestart", fn, null, context, arg1, arg2, arg3)</code></p>
 *
 * @event gesturemovestart
 * @for YUI
 * @param type {string} "gesturemovestart"
 * @param fn {function} The method the event invokes. It receives the event facade of the underlying DOM event (mousedown or touchstart.touches[0]) which contains position co-ordinates.
 * @param cfg {Object} Optional. An object which specifies:
 *
 * <dl>
 * <dt>minDistance (defaults to 0)</dt>
 * <dd>The minimum distance threshold which should be crossed before the gesturemovestart is fired</dd>
 * <dt>minTime (defaults to 0)</dt>
 * <dd>The minimum time threshold for which the finger/mouse should be help down before the gesturemovestart is fired</dd>
 * <dt>button (no default)</dt>
 * <dd>In the case of a mouse input device, if the event should only be fired for a specific mouse button.</dd>
 * <dt>preventDefault (defaults to false)</dt>
 * <dd>Can be set to true/false to prevent default behavior as soon as the touchstart or mousedown is received (that is before minTime or minDistance thresholds are crossed, and so before the gesturemovestart listener is notified) so that things like text selection and context popups (on touch devices) can be 
 * prevented. This property can also be set to a function, which returns true or false, based on the event facade passed to it (for example, DragDrop can determine if the target is a valid handle or not before preventing default).</dd>
 * </dl>
 *
