    /**
    Hash of view-name to metadata used to declaratively describe an
    application's views and their relationship with the app and other views.

    The view info in `views` is an Object keyed to a view name and can have any
    or all of the following properties:

      * `type`: Function or a string representing the view constructor to use to
        create view instances. If a string is used, the constructor function is
        assumed to be on the `Y` object; e.g. `"SomeView"` -> `Y.SomeView`.

      * `preserve`: Boolean for whether the view instance should be retained. By
        default, the view instance will be destroyed when it is no longer the
        `activeView`. If `true` the view instance will simply be `removed()`
        from the DOM when it is no longer active. This is useful when the view
        is frequently used and may be expensive to re-create.

      * `parent`: String to another named view in this hash that represents
        parent view within the application's view hierarchy; e.g. a `"photo"`
        view could have `"album"` has its `parent` view. This parent/child
        relationship is a useful cue for things like transitions.

      * `instance`: Used internally to manage the current instance of this named
        view. This can be used if your view instance is created up-front, or if
        you would rather manage the View lifecycle, but you probably should just
        let this be handled for you.

    If `views` are specified at instantiation time, the metadata in the `views`
    Object here will be used as defaults when creating the instance's `views`.

    Every `Y.App` instance gets its own copy of a `views` object so this Object
    on the prototype will not be polluted.

    @example
        // Imagine that `Y.UsersView` and `Y.UserView` have been defined.
        var app = new Y.App({
            views: {
                users: {
                    type    : Y.UsersView,
                    preserve: true
                },

                user: {
                    type  : Y.UserView,
                    parent: 'users'
                }
            }

        /**
        Whether or not this application's server is capable of properly routing
        all requests and rendering the initial state in the HTML responses.

        This can have three different values, each having particular
        implications on how the app will handle routing and navigation:

          * `undefined`: The best form of URLs will be chosen based on the
            capabilities of the browser. Given no information about the server
            environment a balanced approach to routing and navigation is chosen.

            The server should be capable of handling full-path requests, since
            full-URLs will be generated by browsers using HTML5 history. If this
            is a client-side-only app the server could handle full-URL requests
            by sending a redirect back to the root with a hash-based URL, e.g:

                Request:     http://example.com/users/1
                Redirect to: http://example.com/#/users/1

          * `true`: The server is *fully* capable of properly handling requests
            to all full-path URLs the app can produce.

            This is the best option for progressive-enhancement because it will
            cause *all URLs to always have full-paths*, which means the server
            will be able to accurately handle all URLs this app produces. e.g.

                http://example.com/users/1

            To meet this strict full-URL requirement, browsers which are not
            capable of using HTML5 history will make requests to the server
            resulting in full-page reloads.

          * `false`: The server is *not* capable of properly handling requests
            to all full-path URLs the app can produce, therefore all routing
            will be handled by this App instance.

            Be aware that this will cause *all URLs to always be hash-based*,
            even in browsers that are capable of using HTML5 history. e.g.

                http://example.com/#/users/1

            A single-page or client-side-only app where the server sends a
            "shell" page with JavaScript to the client might have this
            restriction. If you're setting this to `false`, read the following:

        **Note:** When this is set to `false`, the server will *never* receive
        the full URL because browsers do not send the fragment-part to the
        server, that is everything after and including the '#'.

        Consider the following example:

            URL shown in browser: http://example.com/#/users/1
            URL sent to server:   http://example.com/

        You should feel bad about hurting our precious web if you forcefully set
        either `serverRouting` or `html5` to `false`, because you're basically
        punching the web in the face here with your lossy URLs! Please make sure
        you know what you're doing and that you understand the implications.

        Ideally you should always prefer full-path URLs (not /#/foo/), and want
        full-page reloads when the client's browser is not capable of enhancing
        the experience using the HTML5 history APIs. Setting this to `true` is
        the best option for progressive-enhancement (and graceful-degradation).
