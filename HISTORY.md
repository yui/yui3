App Framework Change History
============================

3.5.0
-----

### App

* Initial release.

### Model

* [!] The `validate()` method is now asynchronous, and is expected to call a
  callback function on success or failure. Old-style synchronous `validate()`
  methods will still work, but are deprecated. [Ticket #2531218]

* Model now supports ad-hoc attributes, which means it's no longer necessary to
  subclass `Y.Model` and declare attributes ahead of time. The following is now
  perfectly valid, and will result in a model instance with "foo" and "bar"
  attributes:

          var model = new Y.Model({foo: 'foo', bar: 'bar'});

* `load()` now fires a `load` event after the operation completes successfully,
  or an `error` event on failure. The `load()` callback (if provided) will still
  be called in both cases. [Ticket #2531207]

* `save()` now fires a `save` event after the operation completes successfully,
  or an `error` event on failure. The `save()` callback (if provided) will still
  be called in both cases. [Ticket #2531207]

* Options passed to `set()` and `setAttrs()` are now correctly merged into the
  event facade of the `change` event. [Ticket #2531492]

* Model's `destroy` event is now fully preventable (previously it was possible
  for the model to be deleted even if the `destroy` event was prevented by a
  subscriber in the `on` phase).

### ModelList

* ModelList's `model` property is now set to `Y.Model` by default. Since
  `Y.Model` now supports ad-hoc attributes, this makes it much easier to create
  and populate a ModelList without doing any subclassing:

          var list = new Y.ModelList();

          list.add([
              {foo: 'bar'},
              {baz: 'quux'}
          ]);

* Added a `filter()` method that returns a filtered array of models or,
  optionally, a new ModelList containing the filtered models. [Ticket #2531250]

* Added a `create` event that fires when a model is created/updated via the
  `create()` method, but before that model has actually been saved and added to
  the list (and before the `add` method has fired). [Ticket #2531400]

* Added a `load` event that fires when models are loaded. [Ticket #2531399]

* Models' `id` attributes (if set) are now used to enforce uniqueness. If you
  attempt to add a model to the list that has the same id as another model in
  the list, an `error` event will be fired and the model will not be added.
  [Ticket #2531409]

* The `add()`, `remove()` and `reset()` methods now accept other ModelList
  instances in addition to models and arrays of models. For example, passing a
  ModelList to `add()` will add all the models in that list to this list as
  well. [Ticket #2531408]

* ModelList now allows you to add models to the list even if they were
  instantiated in another window or another YUI sandbox. [Ticket #2531543]

* ModelList subclasses can now override the protected `_compare()` method to
  customize the low-level comparison logic used for sorting. This makes it easy
  to do things like descending sort, multi-field sorting, etc. See the API docs
  for details.

* The `reset()` method now allows the caller-provided options object to override
  the `src` property that's passed on the event facade of the `reset` event.
  [Ticket #2531888]

### Router (formerly Controller)

* [!] The `Controller` class and `controller` module have been renamed to
  `Router` and `router` respectively. The old names are deprecated, but have
  been retained as aliases for backwards compatibility. They will be removed
  in a future version of YUI.

* [!] The `html5`, `root`, and `routes` properties are now attributes, and
  `routes` may be set both during and after init. Code that refers to the old
  properties, like `myController.root` and `myController.root = '/foo'`, must be
  updated to use the attribute syntax instead: `myRouter.get('root')` and
  `myRouter.set('root', '/foo')`.

* [!] The signature for route handlers has changed. Route handlers now receive
  three arguments: `req`, `res`, and `next`. To preserve backcompat, `res` is a
  function that, when executed, calls `next()`. This behavior is deprecated and
  will be removed in a future version of YUI, so please update your route
  handlers to expect `next` as the third param.

* `"*"` can now be used to create a wildcard route that will match any path
  (previously it was necessary to use a regex to do this). Additionally, paths
  which contain a `"*"` (e.g., `"/users/*"`) act as a wildcard matching
  everything after it.

* The `hasRoute()` method now accepts full URLs as well as paths.

* The hashes used when `html5` is `false` are now root-less; the router's `root`
  is removed from the hash before it is set on the URL.

* When multiple Router instances exist on a page, calling `save()` in one will
  now cause matching routes to be dispatched in all routers, rather than only
  the router that was the source of the change.

* Added `url` and `src` properties to the request object that's passed to route
  handlers.

* Made the `html5` config attribute writable. This allows you to force a router
  to use (`true`) or not use (`false`) HTML5 history. Please don't set it to
  `false` unless you understand the consequences.

* Added a workaround for a nasty iOS 5 bug that destroys stored references to
  `window.location` when the page is restored from the page cache. We already
  had a workaround in place since this issue is present in desktop Safari as
  well, but the old workaround no longer does the trick in iOS 5.
  [Ticket #2531608]

### View

* [!] The `container`, `model`, and `modelList` properties are now attributes.
  Code that refers to the old properties, like `myView.model` and
  `myView.model = model`, must be updated to use the attribute syntax instead:
  `myView.get('model')` and `myView.set('model', model)`.

* [!] The `container` attribute now treats string values as CSS selectors.
  Previously, it assumed string values represented raw HTML. To get the same
  functionality as the old behavior, pass your HTML string through
  `Y.Node.create()` before passing it to `container`.

* [!] Destroying a view no longer also destroys the view's container node by
  default. To destroy a view's container node when destroying the view, pass
  `{remove: true}` to the view's `destroy()` method. [Ticket #2531689]

* View now supports ad-hoc attributes, which means it's no longer necessary to
  subclass `Y.View` and declare attributes ahead of time. The following is now
  perfectly valid, and will result in a view instance with "foo" and "bar"
  attributes:

          var view = new Y.View({foo: 'foo', bar: 'bar'});

* Added a `containerTemplate` property that contains an HTML template used to
  create a container node when one isn't specified. Defaults to "<div/>".

* When no `container` node is specified at instantiation time, the container
  won't be created until it's needed. `create()` is now only used to create a
  default container; it's never called when a custom container node is
  specified.

* Added a View extension, `Y.View.NodeMap`, that can be mixed into a `View`
  subclass to provide a static `getByNode()` method that returns the nearest
  View instance associated with a given Node (similar to `Widget.getByNode()`).


3.4.1
-----

### Controller

* Added a workaround for an iOS 4 bug that causes the previous URL to be
  displayed in the location bar after calling `save()` or `replace()` with a
  new URL.

* Fixed a bug that caused the controller to get stuck in a "dispatching" state
  if `save()` was called with no routes defined.

### Model

* The `validate()` method is now only called when `save()` is called, rather
  than on every attribute change. If validation fails, the save operation will
  be aborted.

3.0.0pr1
---------

  * Initial release.



Attribute Change History
========================

3.5.0
-----

  * Broke Y.Attribute up into:

    - Y.AttributeCore
    - Y.AttributeEvents
    - Y.AttributeExtras

    To support core Attribute usage, without Events, but still allow upgrade 
    path to add Events, if required.

    Y.AttributeCore is likely to form the basis for BaseCore and WidgetCore 
    (ala Node Plugins, where low-level state change events are not required). 

    Y.Attribute's public and protected API reimain unchanged, and loader will
    pull in the new dependencies.

    However if you're manually pulling in attribute-base, you'll need to 
    manually pull in attribute-core, attribute-events and attribute-extras 
    before it.

    Summary:

    Y.Attribute     - Common Attribute Functionality (100% backwards compat)
    Y.AttributeCore - Lightest Attribute support, without CustomEvents

    --

    Y.AttributeEvents - Augmentable Attribute Events support
    Y.AttributeExtras - Augmentable 20% usage for Attribute (modifyAttr, removeAttr, reset ...)
    Y.AttributeComplex - Augmentable support for constructor complex attribute parsing ({"x.y":foo})

    --

    Y.Attribute = Y.AttributeCore + Y.AttributeEvents + Y.AttributeExtras

    --

    Modules:

    "attribute-base" : Y.Attribute
    "attribute-core" : Y.AttributeCore

    "attribute-complex" : Y.AttributeComplex mixin (mixed into Y.Attribute)
    "attribute-events" : Y.AttributeEvents mixin
    "attribute-extras" : Y.AttributeExtras mixin

  * Changed State's internal data structure, to store pairs by 
    [name][property], instead of [property][name] to improve performance
    (most Attribute operations are name centric, not property centric).

    If you're working directly with Attribute's private _state.data, you
    may need to update your code to account for the change in structure. 

  * Attribute now passes the attribute name to valueFn, allowing users to
    write shared valueFn impls across attributes.

3.4.1
-----

  * No changes.

3.4.0
-----

  * Added params to constructor, to support call to addAttrs on construction
    with user values, when augmenting and invoking constructor manually.
  
    Also broke out addAttrs logic on construction (introduced for Node),
    into it's own _initAttrs method to facilitate customization.

3.3.0
-----

  * Changed instanceof to Y.instanceOf, to prevent leaks in IE7

3.2.0
-----

  * Added protected helper method (_getAttrCfg) to return the configuration
    for a given attribute. 

3.1.1
-----

  * Fixed ticket #2528753 : Sub attribute value crashed after setting another 
    sub attribute. 

3.1.0
-----

  * writeOnce can be set to "initOnly", which can be used 
    to prevent the user from setting the value outside of the initial
    configuration when using the addAttrs. 

    When used with Base, this means that the user can only define a 
    value for the Attribute during construction.

  * Attribute change events are now published with the defaultTargetOnly 
    property set to true.

  * newVal property of event object passed to change event listeners will 
    now be the value returned from the Attribute's getter (if defined)

  * setter, getter, validator and valueFn can now be specified as 
    strings, referring to the method names to be invoked on the Attribute
    instance.

3.0.0
-----

  * set/get can now be called for ad-hoc attributes (attributes which 
    have not been added/configured).

  * Fixed issue where custom getters were being called with undefined values,
    for the initial set.

  * Limited the case for which an attribute will not notify after listeners, 
    if the value is unchanged after a set, to primitive values (values for 
    which Lang.isObject(newVal) returns false).

    This allows after listeners to be invoked, when resetting the value to 
    the same object reference, which has properties updated, or arrays with
    elements modified. 

  * Attribute broken up into attribute-base and attribute-complex submodules.

    attribute-complex adds support for complex attributes ({x.y.z : 5}) to
    addAttrs. 

3.0.0 beta 1
------------

  * Removed Attribute.CLONE support in the interests of simplicity.
    Was not being used. Can re-evaluate support if real world demand 
    for it exists. 

  * Changed "set" and "get" configuration properties for setter and 
    getter methods to "setter" and "getter" respectively.

  * Added support for setter to return Attribute.INVALID_VALUE
    to prevent attribute state from being changed. 

    This allows developers to combine setter and validator 
    functionality into one method if performance optimization 
    is required.

  * "validator" is now invoked before "setter".

  * Renamed xxxAtt and xxxAtts methods to xxxAttr, xxxAttrs for
    consistency.

  * "after" listeners are only notified if attribute value really
    changes (preVal !== newVal).

  * Extending classes can now overwrite ATTRS configuration properties 
    from super classes, including writeOnce and readOnly attributes.

    The ATTRS configurations are merged across the class hierarchy,
    before they are used to initialize the attributes.

  * addAttr now prevents re-adding attributes which are already 
    configured in order to maintain consistent state.

  * Event prefix wrapper functions (on, after etc.) removed - 
    Event.Target now accepts an event prefix configuration value
  
  * Added additional log messages to assist with debugging.

  * Attribute change events are no longer fired for initial set.

  * Split up State add/get/remove into add/addAll, get/getAll, 
    remove/removeAll to avoid having to create object literals for 
    critical path [ add/get single key values ].

  * Attribute getter, setter, validator now also receive attribute name 
    as the 2nd arg (val, name).

  * If Attributes initialized through addAttrs have a user provided value 
    which is not valid, the initial attribute value will revert to the 
    default value in the attribute configuration, if it exists.

  * reset() no longer resets readOnly or writeOnce attributes. Only 
    publically settable values are reset.

  * Added modifyAttr method, to allow component developer to modify 
    configuration of an attribute which has already been added. The set of 
    attribute configuration properties which can be modified after it 
    has been added are limited to getter, readOnly, writeOnce and broadcast.

  * Added support for lazy attribute configuration. Base uses this feature 
    to lazily intialize all Attributes on the first call to get/set, for 
    performance optimization. 

    lazyAdd:true/false can be used to over-ride this behavior for a 
    particular attribute. 

3.0.0PR2
--------

  * Added valueFn support, to allowing static 
    attribute values configuration to set instance
    based values.
  
  * Added reset method.

  * Added private setter for use by class implementation
    code to set readOnly, writeOnce values.

3.0.0PR1 - Initial release
--------------------------



AutoComplete Change History
===========================

3.5.0
-----

* Added an `enableCache` config attribute. Set this to `false` to prevent the
  built-in result sources from caching results (it's `true` by default).

* The `requestTemplate` value is now made available to YQL sources via the
  `{request}` placeholder, which works just like the `{query}` placeholder. Use
  this when you need to customize the query value (such as double-escaping it)
  used in the YQL query. [Ticket #2531285]

* Changing the value of the `value` attribute programmatically will now also
  update the value of the `query` attribute and will fire a `clear` event when
  the value is cleared (thus clearing results), but still will not fire a
  `query` event. Use the `sendRequest()` method to trigger a query
  programmatically.

* Added a workaround for an IE7 bug that would cause the result list to appear
  empty when it first becomes visible.

* Fixed a bug that caused a scrollable result list to be hidden when the user
  clicked and dragged on the scrollbar and then released the mouse button while
  the cursor was outside the list region.

* Fixed a bug that caused the list to disappear on mouseover if the input field
  received focus before the AutoComplete widget was initialized
  [Ticket #2531651]

* Fixed a bug that could prevent results from being selected via mouse click
  after a result was selected via the tab key. [Ticket #2531684]

* Fixed a bug that prevented the list from being re-aligned when the window was
  resized.


3.4.1
-----

* The "combobox" ARIA role is no longer automatically added to an
  AutoCompleteList input node. After consulting with the Y! Accessibility
  team, we felt that the combobox role doesn't accurately represent the
  out-of-the-box interactions that AutoCompleteList provides. Implementers can
  still apply this role (or any other ARIA role) to the input node manually if
  desired.

* Fixed a bug that prevented the autocomplete list from being hidden after
  right-clicking on the list and then clicking elsewhere in the document.
  [Ticket #2531009]


3.4.0
-----

* Added the ability to use a `<select>` node as a result source.

* Function sources may now be either asynchronous or synchronous. Returning
  an array of results from a function source will cause it to be treated as
  synchronous (same as in 3.3.0). For async operation, don't return anything,
  and pass an array of results to the provided callback function when the
  results become available. [Ticket #2529974]

* Added a `sourceType` attribute to `AutoCompleteBase`, which may be used to
  force a specific source type, overriding the automatic source type
  detection. [Ticket #2529974]

* The `scrollIntoView` config option is now much smarter. It will only scroll
  if the selected result isn't fully visible. If the result is already
  entirely within the visible area of the viewport, no scrolling will occur.

* A pre-existing `listNode` may now be specified at initialization time.

* Added `subWordMatch` filters and highlighters. [Contributed by Tobias
  Schultze]

* The `this` object now refers to the current AutoComplete instance instead of
  the window in list locators, text locators, filters, formatters,
  highlighters, and requestTemplate functions.

* Added an `originEvent` property to the event facade of `select` events. It
  contains an event facade of the DOM event that triggered the selection if
  the selection was triggered by a DOM event.

* Small performance improvement for filters operating on empty query strings.
  [Ticket #2529949]

* Result list alignment is now updated both when results change and when
  the window is resized instead of only when the list becomes visible. This
  makes right-aligned lists with dynamic widths less awkward.

* Fixed a bug that prevented CSS-based z-index values from taking effect on
  the AutoComplete list and required the z-index to be set via JS. The
  `.yui3-aclist` class now provides a default z-index of 1, and this can be
  overridden with custom CSS. Specifying a `zIndex` attribute value via JS
  no longer has any effect.

* Fixed a bug that caused the IE6 iframe shim under the AutoComplete list to
  be sized incorrectly the first time the list was displayed.

* Fixed a bug in which the `requestTemplate` would sometimes be used as the
  query instead of being appended to the source URL. This affected XHR and
  JSONP sources that used both a `{query}` placeholder in the source string
  and a custom `requestTemplate` value. [Ticket #2529895]

* Fixed a bug that caused the `requestTemplate` function to be called twice
  for an XHR request instead of just once.

* Fixed a bug in which JSONP, XHR, and YQL requests were cached solely based
  on the query rather than on the complete request. This could result in
  cache collisions when two requests with the same query but different
  parameters (provided by a requestTemplate) were made. [Ticket #2530410]

* Fixed a bug that caused the `&` character to be treated as an up arrow
  key in Firefox. [Ticket #2530455]

* Removed the "beta" label. Hooray!


3.3.0
-----

* Initial release.



Base Change History
===================

3.5.0
-----

  * Only invoke Base constructor logic once to 
    support multi-inheritance scenario in which
    an extension passed to Base.create inherits from Base
    itself.

    NOTE: To support multiple inhertiance more deeply, we'd 
    need to remove the hasOwnProperty restriction around object
    key iteration.

  * Added Y.BaseCore which is core Base functionality without
    Custom Events (it uses Y.AttributeCore instead of Y.Attribute).

    Y.BaseCore still maintains the ATTRS handling, init/destroy
    lifecycle and plugin support, but doesn't fire any custom evnets
    of it's own (the idea is that it will the base for Node-Plugin 
    type components, built off of a WidgetCore) 

    Y.Base is now Y.BaseCore + Y.Attribute, and is 100% backwards
    compatible.

    Summary:

    Y.Attribute     - Common Attribute Functionality (100% backwards compat)
    Y.Base          - Common Base Functionality (100% backwards compat)
   
    Y.AttributeCore - Lightest Attribute support, without CustomEvents
    Y.BaseCore      - Lightest Base support, without CustomEvents

    --

    Y.AttributeEvents - Augmentable Attribute Events support
    Y.AttributeExtras - Augmentable 20% usage for Attribute (modifyAttr, removeAttr, reset ...)
    Y.AttributeComplex - Augmentable support for constructor complex attribute parsing ({"x.y":foo})

    --
 
    Y.Attribute = Y.AttributeCore + Y.AttributeEvents + Y.AttributeExtras
    Y.Base      = Y.BaseCore + Y.Attribute

    -- 

    Modules:
    
    "base-base" : Y.Base
    "base-core" : Y.BaseCore

    "base-build" : Y.Base.build/create/mix mixin

  * Extended Base.create/mix support for _buildCfg, to Extensions, mainly so that
    extensions can define a whitelist of statics which need to be copied to the 
    main class.

    e.g.

    MyExtension._buildCfg = {
       aggregates:["newPropsToAggregate"...],
       custom: {
           newPropsToCustomMix
       },
       statics: ["newPropsToCopy"]
    };

3.4.1
-----

  * No changes.

3.4.0
-----

  * Base now destroys plugins before destroying itself

  * Base.create/mix extensions can now define initializer and 
    destructor prototype functions, which will get invoked after
    the initializer for the host class into which they are mixed and
    before it's destructor.

  * Use a hash version of whitelist mix for improved performance.
    Also removed non-required hasOwnProperty check and delete.

3.3.0
-----

  * Fixed Base.mix when used on a class created using Base.create

  * toString no longer inadvertently stamps the object, however,
    we now stamp Base objects in the constructor, to support
    use cases where the "toString" stamping was implicitly being
    relied upon (e.g. in DD, as hashkeys).

3.2.0
-----

  * Fixed Base.create to properly isolate ATTRS on extensions

3.1.1
-----	

  * No changes 

3.1.0
-----

  * As the final step in the destroy phase, Base now does a detachAll() to avoid invoking listeners 
    which may be waiting to be in an async. step which occurs after destruction.

  * "init" and "destroy" events are now published with the defaultTargetOnly property set to true

  * Added support for MyClass.EVENT_PREFIX to allow developers
    to define their own event prefix

  * Made "init" and "destroy" events fireOnce:true (along with
    "render" in Widget), so that subscriptions made after the 
    events are fired, are notified immediately.

  * Dynamic and non-dynamically built classes now have their 
    extensions instantiated the same way - during _initHierarchy.

  * Updated ATTRS handling for Base.build, so that ATTRS are 
    also aggregated at the attribute configuration object level, 
    allowing extensions to add to, or overwrite, attribute 
    configuration properties on the host.

  * Added sugar Base.create and Base.mix methods on top of 
    Base.build, to simplify the 2 main use cases: 

    1) Creating a completely new class which uses extensions.
    2) Mixing in extensions to an existing class.

  * Documented non-attribute on, after, bubbleTargets and plugins 
    property support in the Base constructor config argument 

3.0.0
-----

  * Fixed hasImpl method on built classes, to look up the class
    hierarchy for applied extensions.

  * Plugin.Host removed from base-base module and delivered as it's 
    own module - "pluginhost"

  * base broken up into..

     base-base: Provides class hierarchy support for ATTRS and 
     initialization

     base-build: Provides Extension support in the form of 
     Base.build

     base-pluginhost: Augments Plugin.Host to Base, adding plugin
     support

3.0.0 beta 1
------------

  * Config argument for init event now merged into the event facade, 
    instead of being passed separately (available as e.cfg).
  
  * Removed Base.create. On review, considered to be overkill.
    Users can easily create new instances, using Base.build

  * Moved PluginHost down from Widget to Base, since utils and 
    Node will also support Plugins.

  * PluginHost.plug and unplug now accept the plugin class as 
    arguments [plug(pluginClass, cfg) and unplug(pluginClass)].

  * Split base module up into base-base and base-build.

  * Added lazy attribute initialization support, to improve performance.
  
    This also removes order dependency when processing ATTRS for a 
    particular class.

    If a get/set call is made for an uninitialized attribute A, in the 
    getter/setter/validator or valueFns of another attribute B, A will 
    be intiailized on the fly. 

  * Added ability to subscribe to on/after events through the 
    constructor config object, e.g.:

      new MyBaseObject({ 
         on: {
            init: handlerFn,
            myAttrChange: handlerFn
	     },
	     after: {
	       init: handlerFn,
	       myAttrChange: handlerFn
	     },
	     ...
      });

  * Developers can now override the default clone behavior we use to
    isolate default ATTRS config values, using cloneDefaultValue, e.g.:

    ATTRS = {
      myAttr : {
      	value: AnObjectOrArrayReference
	    cloneDefaultValue: true|false|"deep"|"shallow"
      }
    }

    If the cloneDefaultValue property is not defined, Base will clone
    any Arrays or Object literals which are used as default values when
    configuring attributes for an instance, so that updates to instance 
    values do not modify the default value.

    This behavior can be over-ridden using the cloneDefaultValue property:

    true, deep: 

      Use Y.clone to protect the default value.

    shallow:

      Use Y.merge, to protect the default value.

    false:

      Don't clone Arrays or Object literals. The value is intended
      to be used by reference, for example, when it points to
      a utility object.

  * Base.plug and Base.unplug used to add static Plugins (default plugins
    for a class). Replaces static PLUGINS array, allowing subclasses to 
    easily unplug static plugins added higher up in the hierarchy.

  * Base adds all attributes lazily. This means attributes don't get
    initialized until the first call to get/set, speeding up construction
    of Base based objects.

    Attributes which have setters which set some other state in the object, 
    can configure the attribute to disable lazy initialization, by setting
    lazyAdd:false as part of their attribute configuration, so that the setter
    gets invoked during construction.

Collection Change History
=========================

3.5.0
-----

* YUI now detects non-native ES5 shims added to native objects by other
  libraries and falls back to its own internal shims rather than relying on the
  potentially broken code from the other library.
* Deprecated arraylist-add and arraylist-filter in favor of individual
  subclass implementations or ModelList.


3.4.1
-----

  future version of YUI.
* `Array.lastIndexOf` now supports the `fromIndex` parameter as specified in
  ES5.

-----

    resizes the `boundingBox` accordingly.

    Default to `false` so when a `Console` is instantiated, messages are
    redirected to `Console` rather than duplicated there.

  * `collapse()`, `expand()`, and `log()` are now chain-able.

3.0.0beta1
----------

  * `logSource` attribute added to configure listening for events from a

3.0.0b1
-------

  * Synchronized with the 2.x version of cookie:
    * Changes formatting of date from `toGMTString()` to `toUTCString()` (trac#
      2527892). 
    * Updated `remove()` so that it no longer modifies the options object that
      is passed in (trac# 2527838).
    * Changed behavior for Boolean cookies (those that don't contain an equals
      sign). Previously, calling `Cookie.get()` on a Boolean cookie would return
      the name of the cookie. Now, it returns an empty string. This is necessary
      because IE doesn't store an equals sign when the cookie value is empty
      ("info=" becomes just "info").
    * Added `Cookie.exists()` to allow for easier Boolean cookie detection.
    * Removed check for cookie value before parsing. Previously, parsing checked
      for `name=value`, now it parses anything that is passed in.
    * Removing the last subcookie with `removeSub()` now removes the cookie if the
      `removeIfEmpty` option is set to `true`. (trac# 2527954)
    * Added option to disable url encoding/decoding by passing `options.raw` to
      `set()` and `get()`. (trac# 2527953).
    * Changed `get()` to take an options object with `raw` and `converter`
      properties. If a function is passed instead of an object then it is used
      as the converter for backward compatibility (trac# 2527953).  


3.0.0pr2

  * Synchronized with latest 2.x version of cookie.

    * Supports fluid 100-percent layouts, fluid- and 
      fixed-width layouts at 750px, 950px, and 974px 
      centered, and the ability to easily customize the 
      width.
    * Flexible in response to user initiated font-size 
      adjustments.
    * Template columns are source-order independent; put
      your most important content earlier in your markup
      for improved accessibility and SEO.
    * Self-clearing footer. No matter which column is
      longer, the footer stays below the longest.
    * Accommodates IAB's Ad Unit Guidelines for common 
      ad dimensions.

DataSchema Change History
=========================

3.5.0
-----

  * No changes.


3.4.1
-----

  * No changes.


3.4.0
-----

### `dataschema-json`
   * Added support to accept the results array as input, leaving
     `schema.resultListLocator` as optional.
   * Field locators that contain . or [???] now fail over to look for that
     locator as a single property name rather than a nested value. For example,
     a locator `"not.nested"` would look for `inputRecord.not.nested` for a
     value, but if it doesn't find one, it will look for
     `inputRecord["not.nested"]`.  If it finds a value there, it will not look
     for a nested value for subsequent records.
   * `getPath` is far more tolerant of locator strings.  In particular, it
     considered utf-8 characters that didn't match the `\w` regex group to be
     invalid.  This is fixed.


3.3.0
-----

   * Bug 2528429: Added support for locator property to DataSchema.JSON
     resultFields.
   * Known Android issues (bugs 2529621, 2529758, 2529775): XML parsing is buggy
     on the Android WebKit browser.


3.2.0
-----

   * Set custom parser execution scope to be DataSchema instance.


3.1.1
-----

  * No changes.


3.1.0
-----

   * Added support for nested schemas.
   * Added support for XPath resultListLocator, instead of requiring the use
     of 'getElementsByTagName'.
   * Improved support for DOM elements in DataSchema.XML when IE
     xmldoc.selectNodes(String) fails.
   * Field list is now optional for DataSchema.JSON.  If omitted, all response
     data is returned.
   * Fixed a bug in field resolution where null might be discovered along the
     resolution path.  Now exits gracefully rather than throwing an error.


3.0.0
-----

   * Support for DOM elements in DataSchema.XML.


3.0.0 beta 1
------------

   * Initial release.



DataSource Change History
=========================

3.5.0
-----

  * No changes.


3.4.1
-----

  * No changes.


3.4.0
-----

### datasource-polling

  * `setInterval` fires first `sendRequest` in a 0ms `setTimout`, then
    subsequent calls after the configured timeout. [Ticket #2529182]

### datasource-function

  * success callbacks that throw an error no longer result in the `data` event
    being fired again. [Ticket #2529824]


3.3.0
-----

  * Un-anonymize `DataSource.IO` callback functions. [Ticket #2529466]


3.2.0
-----

  * Removed hardcoded `DataSource.IO` from `DataSourceJSONSchema`.

  * Added ability to cancel underlying IO and Get transactions.

  * Better `DataSource` error handling.

  * Added `ioConfig` Attribute to `DataSource.IO`.


3.1.1
-----

  * No changes.


3.1.0
-----

  * [!] `DataSource`'s `sendRequest()` argument signature has changed in a
    non-backward-compatible way. It now accepts a single object containing the
    properties `request`, `callback`, and `cfg`.

  * `DataSource.Get` bug fixed where it was trying to delete the proxy callback
    in the wrong location during cleanup.

  * Changed from array of proxy callbacks to object with guid keys to support
    services that don't properly handle array indexes in the callback parameter
    (Twitter).

  * Code reorganized (API and functionality unaffected).


3.0.0
-----

  * `DataSource.IO` now passes request value to IO.

  * `DataSource.Function` now catches exception and fires error event.


3.0.0beta1
------------

  * Initial release.



DataTable Change History
========================

3.5.0
-----

 * Major refactor.  See README for details about the new architecture.
 * Y.DataTable is now instantiable, in addition to Y.DataTable.Base
 * Recordset use has been replaced by ModelList. `recordset` attribute passes through to `data` attribute.  This is incomplete back compat because get('recordset') doesn't return a Recordset instance.
 * Columnset use has been removed. Column configuration is managed as an array of objects. `columnset` attribute passes through to `columns` attribute.  The same incomplete back compat applies.
 * DataTable doesn't render the table contents or header contents. That is left to `bodyView` and `headerView` classes.
 * Support for rendering a `<tfoot>` is baked in.
 * `datatable-datasource` modified to update a DataTable's `data` attribute rather than the (deprecated) `recordset`.
 * Scrollable tables now support captions
 * Added datatable-mutable module to provide addRow, removeRow, addColumn, etc
 * Added datatable-column-widths module to set column widths
 
 * Liner `<div>`s have been removed from the cell template in the default markup
 * `<colgroup>` is not rendered by default (added via `datatable-column-widths` extension)
 * message `<tbody>` is not added by default (compatibility module not added yet)
 * CSS uses `border-collapse: collapse` for all user agents instead of `separate` for most, but `collapse` for IE
 * CSS for base only includes styles appropriate to rendering the base markup
 * header gradient rendered as CSS gradient where possible, falling back to background image.
 * Added class "yui3-datatable-table" to the `<table>`
 * Added class "yui3-datatable-header" to all `<th>`s
 * Changed class "yui3-column-foo" to "yui3-datatable-col-foo" for `<th>`s and `<td>`s
 * Added class "yui3-datatable-cell" to all `<td>`s
 * CSS no longer references tags, only classes
 * ARIA grid, row, and gridcell roles added to the markup templates
 
 * `recordset` attribute deprecated in favor of `data` attribute
 * `columnset` attribute deprecated in favor of `columns` attribute
 * `tdValueTemplate`, `thValueTemplate`, and `trTemplate` attributes and `tdTemplate` and `thTemplate` properties dropped in favor of CELL_TEMPLATE and ROW_TEMPLATE properties on the `bodyView` and `headerView` instances.
 * Now fires `renderTable`, `renderHeader`, `renderBody`, and `renderFooter` events
 * Added `data`, `head`, `body`, and `foot` properties to contain instances of the ModelList and section Views.
 * Columns now MAY NOT have `key`s with dots in them.  It competes with Attribute's support for complex attributes. When parsing data with DataSchema.JSON, use the `locator` configuration to extract the value, but use a simple `key` to store/reference it from DT.


3.4.1
-----

  * Removed the `td` property from the object passed to cell formatters by
    default.  Implementers should return innerHTML or modify the `tdTemplate`
    and set properties on the `o` object passed to the formatter for
    template substitution.  For implementers that *must* have a Node for the
    cell, a new prototype method `createCell(o)` may be called from formatters.
    The method creates a Node using the standard template substitution of
    `tdTemplate` + values stored in `o`.  It then adds the cell Node to the
    `td` property on `o` and returns the created Node.  That said, using strings
    will make the table faster (maybe not in this release, but in 3.5.0).
    [Ticket #2529920]

  * Added a column attribute `emptyCellValue` to populate cells without content
    values. In your column definition, specify a value you want to show in the
    rendered cell in the case of missing data.  The default `emptyCellValue` is
    the empty string, so no more "{value}" showing up in tables.
    [Ticket #2529921]

3.4.0
-----

  * Render cycle revamped to avoid calls through the Attribute API for each
    cell.  This should improve render performance somewhat.  More performance
    improvements to come in 3.5.0.  The object passed through the render loops'
    supporting methods now has additional properties and many properties are
    added earlier.  o.td still refers to the cell added by the previous
    loop iteration--a proper fix is coming in 3.5.0. Look in the Gallery for
    a patch module.

  * Now creates a new `RecordSet` for each instance rather than reusing the same
    one. [Ticket #2529980]
  
  * Captions are only added if a value is set for the `caption` attribute
    [Ticket #2529968]


3.3.0
-----

  * Initial release.
  
  * Known Android issue (Ticket #2529761): Scrolling is currently not supported
    on the Android WebKit browser.

* #2528124 Fixed issue with creating more than one DD instance on a node.
* #2528149 Fixed _noShim use case


### 3.0.0 Beta1

Added a plugin to support Window and Node based scrolling

    var dd = new Y.DD.Drag({
        node: '#drag'
    }).plug(Y.plugin.DDWinScroll);

    var dd = new Y.DD.Drag({
        node: '#drag'
    }).plug(Y.plugin.DDNodeScroll, {
        node: '#some-parent-with-scroll'
    });

Proxy and Constrained were moved to the plugin modal, there are some syntax changes:

PR2 - Proxy:

    var dd = new Y.DD.Drag({
        node: '#drag',
        proxy: true,
        moveOnEnd: false
    });

Current - Proxy:

    var dd = new Y.DD.Drag({
        node: '#drag'
    }).plug(Y.plugin.DDProxy, {
        moveOnEnd: false
    });

PR2 - Constrained:

    var dd = new Y.DD.Drag({
        node: '#drag',
        constrain2node: '#wrap'
    });

Current - Constrained:

    var dd = new Y.DD.Drag({
        node: '#drag'
    }).plug(Y.plugin.DDConstrained, {
        constrain2node: '#wrap'
    });

Converted Everything to use setXY now that FF2 is not supported.
Performance tweaks to dragging over a target.

### 3.0.0 PR2

Added bubbles config option to help with extending later.
Updated _checkRegion to perform Bottom, Top, Left, Right validation instead of Top, Bottom, Left, Right

### 3.0.0 PR1

Known Issues:

* Firefox 2.x:
    Proxy Drags with handles inside an element with overflow: hidden will not target properly.

* All:
    Scrolling Module not available as of this release.




Dial Change History
===================

3.5.0
-----

  * Changed method name from _recalculateDialCenter to _calculateDialCenter
   
  * Changed property name from _centerXOnPage to _dialCenterX
    and from _centerYOnPage to _dialCenterY
    
  * Known issue: On IE7, when browser is zoomed, clicking on dial gives the
    wrong value.
    
  * Multiple instances of Dial all had the same ARIA label. 
    They are now unique. Screenreaders now read both the label and the value.
    [Ticket #2531505]   

3.4.1
-----

  * Changed method name from _getNewValueFromMousedown to _handleMousedown

  * Improved mousedown on ring handling [Ticket #2530597]
 
  * Improved handling of dragging the handle past max/min and around multiple
    revolutions. [Ticket #2530766]
    
  * Fixed problem with Dial having incorrect center X and Y following a browser
    resize. [Ticket #2531111]                  

3.4.0
-----

  * Names of 3 configuration attributes have changed:
    stepsPerRev       ->   stepsPerRevolution
    handleDist        ->   handleDistance
    centerButtonDia   ->   centerButtonDiameter 
     
  * New configuration attributes:
    markerDiameter
    handleDiameter
	
  * Enhancement:
    In addition to setting the Dial by dragging the handle as it was in 3.3.0,
    Dial now supports setting the value by clicking on the Ring.
    This does not cross value "wrapping" boundries. 
    For example: If a Dial has 0 degrees = value 0, 
    and the Dial's current handle position is 10 degrees with a value = 10, 
    then a mousedown at 355 degrees will result in a value of 355 not -10.
    In this case all mousedown events will result in values between 0 and 355.
    This is within current value "wrapping" boundries.
    Moving across value wrapping boundaries, must be done by dragging the handle
    or using the keyboard.

  * Changed the name of class 
    marker-max-min
    - to - 
    yui3-dial-marker-max-min
	
  * Enhancement:
    In 3.3.0, when the user dragged the handle past the min or max, the Marker
    displayed as red to indicate min/max.
    When the cursor was released, the marker was no longer displayed.
    There remained no user feedback indicating max/min.
    When the keyboard was used to change the value, no min/max indication was
    displayed, except that the handle stopped moving.
    In this release, the Marker display state of red remains as long as the
    Dial is at min/max, regardless of mouse or keyboard use.
    If you don't want min/max feedback, CSS class yui3-dial-marker-max-min
    can be overridden.

  * When mousedown is used to set its value, Dial now has intuitive handling of
    different configurations of min, max where stepsPerRevolution is
    greater than or less than one revolution. [Ticket #2530306]

3.3.0
-----

  * New Beta Component
    Deprecated _setLabelString, _setTooltipString, _setResetString. 
    Instead, use DialObjName.set('strings',{'label':'My new label',
    'resetStr';'My New Reset'});   before DialObjName.render();
    One or more strings can be changed at a time.
    Removed _setXYResetString. Now done through CSS.
    Not called by Dial.js anymore.




DOM Change History
==================

Bug #2531329 changed the old Y.Selection to Y.EditorSelection. This has been aliased until 3.6.0, bug #2531659
created to track that change.

###3.4.1

No changes.

### 3.4.0

Third release of EditorBase. Considerable work was done on this component, but there are no
public tickets associated with the issues that were resolved. This version of EditorBase is the 
current version being used in the new Yahoo! Mail. It's production stable and ready to be used with
the proper skins and GUI.

### 3.3.0

Second release of EditorBase. Considerable work was done on this component, but there are no
public tickets associated with the issues that were resolved.

### 3.2.0

Initial Release

This release is a core utility release, the Editor instance that is created contains no GUI.
It's only the iframe rendering and event system.



Escape Change History
=====================

3.5.0
-----

* `regex()` no longer escapes the `#` character, since it has no special meaning
  in JS regexes.


3.4.1
-----

* No changes.


3.4.0
-----

* Non-string arguments to `html()` and `regex()` are now coerced to strings.
  [Ticket #2530408]


3.3.0
-----

* Initial release.



Event Infrastructure Change History
===================================

3.5.0
-----
  * `event-simulate` references to `window` replaced with `Y.config.win`
    [#2531223]
  * `event-resize` no longer throws an exception in IE [#2531310]
  * "avilable" and "contentready" handlers that throw exceptions no longer
    result in infinite polling [#2531375]
  * Added `event-touch`, `event-flick`, `event-move`, and `event-valuechange` to
    the `event` virtual rollup in accordance with the docs.
  * 'key' event does a better job parsing character filters. Uses `e.which`
    instead of `e.keyCode` or `e.charCode`.
  * `node.delegate('focus', fn, '.not-focusable')` now works.  Properly supports
    delegation where the filter matches non-focusable parent nodes of the
    focused target. Same for blur. [#2531334] (`event-focus`)
  * `node.delegate('focus', fn, filterThatMatchesNode); node.focus();` now
    works. [#2531734]

3.4.1
-----
  * Calling Y.on('syntheticEvent', callback) without a context/selector argument
    now defaults to `window` (or the global object) [Ticket #2530081]

  * event-resize, a.k.a. Y.on('windowresize', ...) migrated to synthetic event
    infrastructure. Now detachable, etc. Also properly throttles the resize
    event on newer Gecko engines. That browser sniff was old! [Ticket #2530805]

3.4.0
-----
  * `event-outside` added for "outside" events.

  * `Y.Event.define(name)` adds name to `DOM_EVENTS` whitelist. Accepts event
    name string or array of string names.
    
  * `event-hover` properly pulls in required module `event-mouseenter`.
    
  * DOM event subscriptions are now removed and objects cleaned up after last
    subscription is detached; same for synthetic events.
    
  * `key` synthetic event migrated to official synth infrastructure; and now
    supports delegation.
    
  * `key` event spec param now supports letters and named keys. E.g.:
    `'enter+ctrl' == '13+ctrl'`, `'up:a' == 'up:65'` and `'A' == '65+shift'`.
    
  * Added experimental config `YUI({ lazyEventFacade: true })` that triggers a
    mode for DOM EventFacades in IE8 to use getters to access event properties
    that involve any calculation, such as `e.target` and `e.currentTarget`; this
    should also improve performance.
    
  * `mouseenter` and `mouseleave` events now filter the native event rather than
    the generated `DOMEventFacades` for `mouseover`/`mouseout`. This results in
    fewer calls to `Y.one` (`e.target`, `currentTarget`, `relatedTarget`) as
    well, so should improve performance.
    
  * Added `onceAfter()` method to do a self-detaching `after()` subscription.
    [Ticket #2529464]
    
  * `Y.on(type, callback, HTMLElement[], COMPAT)` subscriptions to attach to
    multiple elements in one call now correctly use native DOM elements instead
    of Nodes for all subscriptions. [Ticket #2529807]
    
  * Plugged the leaked global `GLOBAL_ENV`. [Ticket #2530227]
    
  * Fixed synth architecture to properly resubscribe to synths that use
    `processArgs` if the target is not available at the time of subscription.
    [Ticket #2530293]

3.3.0
-----

  * Added support for `delegate({ click: fn, keyup: fn2 }, …)` and
    `delegate(['click', 'keyup'], fn, …)`.
    
  * Delegation containers are now potential matches for the filter.
    
  * Nested delegate matches will now have callback executed for all matching
    targets in bubbling order.
    
  * `e.stopPropagation()` in nested delegate matches now works as expected.
    
  * The raw DOM event is no longer double wrapped (i.e. was: `e._event._event`).
    
  * `event-focus` now uses XHTML-friendly feature test to fork for IE.
    
  * New `event-hover` module providing `node.on('hover', in, out)`.
    
  * `e.button`/`e.which` normalization.
    
  * `e.which` normalized for key operations as well.
    
  * Split out IE-specific code into `event-base-ie` conditional module.

3.2.0
-----

  * Added event and facade support for touch.
    
  * Synthetic event infrastructure rebuilt. Changes include:
    
    * Support for delegation.
        
    * Passing `DOMEventFacade` to `notifier.fire(e)` now recommended.
        
    * Fixed issue where firing the notifier from inside DOM event subs would
      result in duplicate synth sub execution if the same synth was subscribed
      multiple times on the same Node.
        
    * Synths can now be detached with `node.purge(t|f, 'synthName')`.
        
    * `Event.define(type, config, *force*)` third arg added to override existing
      events. Only use this if you really know what you're doing.
        
    * Changed `allowDups` to `preventDups`, `true` by default to mimic existing
      behavior elsewhere in the event system.
    
  * `delegate()` now defers to synthetic event def more intelligently.
    
  * Added support for passing filter function to delegate.
    
  * `delegate()` now executes callback for each filter match up the bubble path.
    
  * Added detach category support to `delegate()`.
    
  * Migrate `mouseenter`, `mouseleave`, `focus`, and `blur` to `Event.define`.
    
  * `focus` and `blur` now guarantee execution order of subs matches bubble
    order when multiple delegates are created from different levels.
    
  * `event-synthetic` added to 'event' rollup module.

3.1.1
-----
    
  * fired `fireOnce()` listeners are executed synchronously.

3.1.0
-----

  * Removed deprecated `delegate` custom event. As of 3.1.0 use the `delegate()`
    method on a `Node` instance or `Y` instance.
    
  * Updated the `event-focus` submodule so that the specialized `focus` and
    `blur` events that enable the `focus` and `blur` events to bubble do not
    apply when adding `focus` and `blur` events to the `window` object.
    
  * Synthetic event creation API added.
    
  * `delegate` enhancements.
    
  * `unload` event fix.
    
  * Compatibility with Firefox's untouchable anonymous `div`.

3.0.0
-----

  * Added `onreadystatechange` fork in `domready` to handle the event in IE when
    YUI is hosted in an `iframe`.
    
  * Added `mousewheel` support.
    
  * Added `Y.delegate()` function that is a bit easier to use than
    `Y.on('delegate', …)`.
    
  * Default scope of `mouseenter` and `mouseleave` events is the `Node` instance
    to which the listener is attached.
    
  * Default scope of delegated event listeners is the `Node` instance that
    matched the supplied CSS selector.
    
  * All special DOM event handlers (`focus`, `blur`, `mousewheel`, `resize`,
    `delegate`, etc.) are broken down into submodules. Core DOM event
    functionality is provided in event-base.js, and all of the functionality is
    rolled into event.js.
    
  * Additional Safari key remapping.
    
  * Special DOM events can now be routed through `delegate()`.
    
  * `Y.on()` can target `Node` and `NodeList` references correctly.
    
  * Fixed `onAvailable()` lazy DOM listener detach handles.
    
  * When configured to return a detach handle, a single object is always
    returned. Previously requests that resolved to multiple listeners returned
    an array.

3.0.0beta1
----------

  * DOM event, custom event, and simulate event moved to separate modules.
    
  * Added an event for DOM event delegation. It only fires if the target or its
    descendants match a supplied selector.
  
        Y.on('delegate', fn, el, 'click', 'selector', …)
    
    The event facade sets the following properties:
    
      * `target`: the target of the event.
      * `currentTarget`: the element that the selector matched.
      * `container`: the bound element (the delegation container).
    
  * Added `mouseenter`/`mouseleave` events:
  
    * `Y.on('mouseenter', fn, el, 'click', 'selector', …)`
    * `Y.on('mouseleave', fn, el, 'click', 'selector', …)`
    
  * Added `Y.on('windowresize', fn)`, which attempts to normalize when the event
    fires across all browsers (once at the end of the resize rather than
    continuously during the resize).
    
  * Fixed `unsubscribeAll()` return value.
    
  * Added ability to skip facade creation where performance is a concern.
    
  * Moved `DOMReady` core to `yui-base`.
    
  * Focus/blur abstraction works in Opera when the bound element is the target.
    
  * `purgeElement` only reads element guids, it does not create new ones for
    elements without one.
    
  * `Event.attach()` returns a single handle if the result from collection
    processing is a single item.

3.0.0pr2
--------

  * Fixed IE notification error when no arguments are supplied.
    
  * Added `event-simulate`.
    
  * `getListeners()` works when the element has no listeners defined.
    
  * `Event.addListener()` removed. Exists only in compat layer.
    
  * `addListerer()` triggers 2.x event behavior.
    
  * Removed extra undefined parameter passed to DOM event listeners.
    
  * Compat layer contains `Event.on()`.
    
  * Event adapter support added to `Y.on()`.
    
  * Added `focus` and `blur` event adaptors (support for propagation of these
    events.)
    
  * publish and subscribe support an object for the type, allowing for multiple
    events/subscriptions.
    
  * subscriber failures throw an error by default rather than log.
    
  * subscriber failures are not routed through `Y.fail` in order to improve the
    debug experience.
    
  * New facades created every `fire()`.
    
  * `before()` method re-added to `EventTarget`, which delegates to
    `Do.before()` or `subscribe()`.
    
  * `EventTarget.after()` will delegate to `Do.after()` if type is a function.
    
  * Added keylistener: `Y.on('key', fn, element, 'down:13,65+ctrl+shift')`.
    
  * `event:ready` event deprecated in favor of `domready`.

3.0.0pr1
--------

  * Initial Release.



Custom Event Infrastructure Change History
==========================================

3.5.0
-----

  * Multiple calls to target.publish({ ... }) now work [Ticket #2531671]

3.4.1
-----

  * onceAfter (added in 3.4.0) now works for array and object signatures.
    [Ticket #2531121]

3.4.0
-----

  * Custom events published from `Y` no longer bubble by default.

3.3.0
-----

  * Undocumented and poorly named `each()` method on EventHandle changed to
    `batch()`.

  * After listeners for events fired in a `defaultFn` or listener are queued in
    the correct order.

  * Added `Y.Do.originalRetVal` and `Y.Do.currentRetVal` statics accessible by
    `Y.Do.after()` subscribers.

  * Exposed the previously private `EventTarget.parseType`.

3.2.0
-----

  * Fixed `defaultTargetOnly` publish configuration.

  * `detach()` now decrements `subCount`/`afterCount`.

  * Detaching via category no longer affects subscriptions on other objects.

3.1.1
-----

  * No changes.

3.1.0
-----

  * Wildcard prefix subscriptions supported: `target.on('*:click', …)` will be
    notified when `tree:click`, `tab:click`, etc are fired.

  * Added `EventTarget::once`, which is equivalent to `on()`, except the
    listener automatically detaches itself once executed.

  * Added event monitoring. When configured, an `EventTarget` will emit events
    for `publish()`, `attach()`, `fire()`, and `detach()` operations on the
    hosted events.

  * `EventTarget::on`'s `type` parameter is overloaded to accept arrays and
    objects for attaching multiple types at once.

  * `EventTarget::detach` returns the event target like the API docs already
    stated.

  * Events can now be configured to execute the `defaultFn` only on the targeted
    object, not on the bubble targets.

  * The event order has been reworked so that the after listeners for the entire
    event stack execute after all `defaultFn` across the entire bubble stack.

3.0.0
-----

  * Broken into core base and complex modules.

  * `broadcast` works for simple events.

  * If configured to return an `EventHandle`, the return value will always be a
    single object, regardless of how many listeners were attached. Previously,
    multiple listeners provided an array of detach handles.

3.0.0beta1
----------

  * [!] Exposed methods are `on()` for the before moment, `after()` for the
    after moment, and `detach()` for unsubscribe. `subscribe()`, `before()`,
    `unsubscribe()`, and corresponding methods are deprecated.
  
  * Implemented the `broadcast` flag:
  
    * `broadcast = 1`: local, accessible via `Y.on('prefix:event')`.
    * `broadcast = 2`: global, accessible via `Y.on()` or globally via
      `Y.Global.on('prefix:event')`.
  
    Broadcast listeners cannot effect the `defaultFn` or host subscribers (so
    are in effect, after listeners), although this is still possible by added
    either `Y` or `Y.Global` as `EventTarget`s.

  * Moved `event-custom` out of `event` package.

  * `EventTarget` accepts a `prefix` configuration. This is used in all exposed
    methods to handle shortcuts to event names, e.g., `'click'` and
    `'menu:click'` are the same if the prefix is `'menu'`.

  * Event type accepts a event category which can be used to detach events:
  
        Y.on('category|prefix:event', fn);
        Y.detach('category|prefix:event');
        Y.detach('category|*');

  * Added `chain` config to events that makes the return value the event target
    rather than a detach handle. Use with the detach category prefix.

  * The `type` parameter can be an object containing multiple events to attach:
  
        Y.on({ 'event1': fn1, 'event2': fn2 });

  * `Y.fire` payload for event facades can be another facade or a custom event.



Gestures Change History
=======================

3.5.0
-----

  * Chrome fixed ontouchstart in window bug. No need to caveat
    the touch test for Chrome 6+.

3.4.1
-----

 * Fixed preventDefault:true for flick

3.4.0
-----

 * For flick, reset start time on first move, to handle
   case where user mousesdown/touchstarts but then doesn't
   move their finger for 5s leading to inaccurate velocity.

3.3.0
-----

  * Use touches current target if already set, as opposed
    to over-riding it with touch current target

  * Flick "y" axis param now handled correctly.

3.2.0
-----

  * New beta component




ValueChange Change History
==========================

3.5.0
-----

* Changed the name of the synthetic event to "valuechange" (all lowercase) for
  greater consistency with DOM event names. The older "valueChange" name will
  continue to be supported indefinitely, but for consistency I recommend
  switching to "valuechange".

* Added support for delegated valuechange events. You can now use `delegate()`
  to attach a valuechange event to a container node and be notified of changes
  to any descendant that matches the specified delegation filter.

* The valuechange event facade now includes `currentTarget` and `target`
  properties like a good little synthetic event.


3.4.1
-----

* No changes.


3.4.0
-----

* No changes.


3.3.0
-----

* Focus is now used (in addition to keyboard and mouse events) as a sign that
  we should begin polling for value changes. [Ticket #2529294]

* If the value changes while an element is not focused, that change will no
  longer be reported the next time polling is started (since it couldn't have
  been user input).


3.2.0
-----

* Module renamed to `event-valuechange` and refactored to be a true synthetic
  event.

* The `value` and `oldValue` event facade properties were renamed to `newVal`
  and `prevVal` respectively, for consistency with other change event facades
  throughout the library.

* Performance improvements.


3.1.2
-----

* No changes.


3.1.1
-----

* No changes.


3.1.0
-----

* Initial release as `value-change`.



File Module Change History
==========================

3.5.0
  * New modules


Get Utility Change History
==========================

3.5.0
-----

* [!] The `Y.Get.abort()` method is now deprecated and will be removed in a
  future version of YUI. Use the transaction-level `abort()` method instead.

* [!] The `charset` option is now deprecated and will be removed in a future
  version of YUI. Specify an `attributes` object with a `charset` property
  instead.

* [!] The `win` option, which allowed you to specify the window into which
  nodes should be inserted, is now deprecated and will be removed in a future
  version of YUI. Use the `doc` option instead, which allows you to specify a
  document, as opposed to a window (which makes more sense).

* [!] The `win` property of transaction objects is now deprecated and will be
  removed in a future version of YUI. Since any given request in a transaction
  may now have its node inserted into any document, the best way to get this
  info is to find the request you're interested in inside the transaction's
  `requests` property, then look at that request's `doc` property to figure out
  what document it's associated with.

* [!] The `tId` property of transaction objects is now deprecated and will be
  removed in a future version of YUI. Use the `id` property instead.

* The Get Utility has been completely rewritten to improve performance and add
  much-needed functionality. Backwards compatibility has been maintained, but
  some methods and APIs have been deprecated and will be removed in a future
  version of YUI.

* Multiple scripts within a transaction are now loaded in parallel whenever
  possible in browsers that are capable of preserving execution order regardless
  of load order. This improves performance in those browsers when loading
  multiple scripts.

* Multiple CSS resources within a transaction are now always loaded
  asynchronously, since CSS rules are applied based on the order of link nodes
  in the document, not the order in which resources finish loading. This
  improves performance in all browsers when loading multiple CSS files.

* Script and CSS resources that fail to load due to HTTP or network errors are
  now correctly treated as failures in all browsers that support `error` events
  on script or link nodes. Most browsers support this on script nodes, but only
  Firefox 9+ currently supports this on link nodes.

* CSS load completion is now detected reliably in older versions of
  WebKit (<535.24) and Firefox (<9), which don't support the `load` event on
  link nodes. Unfortunately, while our workaround makes it possible to detect
  when loading is complete, we still can't detect whether it completed
  successfully or with an error, so in these browsers CSS resources are always
  assumed to have loaded successfully.

* Added a `Y.Get.load()` method, which allows you to load both CSS and JS
  resources in a single transaction.

* Added a `Y.Get.js()` method, which is now the preferred way to load JavaScript
  resources. `Y.Get.script()` is now an alias for `js()`.

* Added a new `Y.Get.options` property containing global options that should be
  used as the default for all requests, along with similar `cssOptions` and
  `jsOptions` properties containing default options that apply only to CSS or
  JS requests, respectively, and that take precedence over the global defaults.

* Added a new `pollInterval` option, which allows you to customize the polling
  interval (in milliseconds) used to check for CSS load completion in WebKit and
  Firefox <=8.

* The `css()`, `js()`, `load()`, and `script()` methods now return an instance
  of `Y.Get.Transaction`, which encompasses one or more requests and contains
  useful properties and methods for getting information about and manipulating
  those requests (and related HTML nodes) as a unit.

* The `css()`, `js()`, `load()`, and `script()` methods now accept an optional
  Node.js-style callback function as either the second or third parameter. This
  function will be called after the transaction finishes. The first argument
  is an array of errors, or `null` on success. The second argument is the
  transaction object.

* The `css()`, `js()`, `load()`, and `script()` methods now accept URL strings,
  objects of the form `{url: '...', [... options ...]}`, or arrays of URL
  strings and/or objects. This allows you to specify per-URL options if desired,
  such as node attributes, parent documents, `insertBefore` nodes, etc.

* The logic used to determine where a node should be inserted when no custom
  `insertBefore` node has been specified has changed slightly. By default,
  script and link nodes will now be inserted before the first `<base>` element
  if there is one, or failing that, before the last child of the `<head>`
  element, or if there's no `<head>` element, before the first `<script>`
  element on the page.

* The source for the `get` module has moved from `src/yui` to `src/get`. This
  allows it to be built separately from the core YUI modules.


3.4.1
-----

* No changes.


3.4.0
-----

* Added an `async` option to `script()`. When set to `true`, the specified
  scripts will be loaded asynchronously (i.e. in parallel), and order of
  execution is not guaranteed. The `onSuccess` callback will be called once,
  after all scripts have finished loading.

* Added an `onProgress` callback, which is useful when loading multiple scripts
  either in series or in parallel by passing an array of URLs to `script()`.
  The `onProgress` callback is called each time a script finishes loading,
  whereas `onSuccess` is only called once after all scripts have finished
  loading.


3.3.0
-----

* No changes.


3.2.0
-----

* No changes.


3.1.1
-----

* No changes.


3.1.0
-----

* Inserted script nodes get `charset="utf-8"` by default.


3.0.0
-----

* Initial release.



Graphics Change History
=======================

3.5.0
-----

  * #2531630 Changed BaseGraphic class to GraphicBase.
  * Removed memory leaks from Shape class. 
  * Added defaultGraphicEngine config to allow developer to specify canvas as the preferred graphic technology. 
  * #2531127 Fixed issue in which transforms were not consistent across different browsers.
  * #2531230 Fixed issue in which setting visible at instantiation would throw an error for a shape.
  * #2531359 Fixed issue in which setting attributes in IE would throw errors.
  * #2531460 Fixed issue in which the clear() method would throw errors in IE.
  * #2531465 Fixed typographic error in SVGGraphic class.
  * #2531049 Added matrix option to the shape's transform attribute.
  * #2531126 Added ability animate transform attribute.

3.4.1
-----

  * No changes.


3.4.0
-----

  * Initial release.



Handlebars Change History
=========================

3.5.0
-----

* Initial release.



Highlight Change History
========================

3.5.0
-----
  * No change.


3.4.1
-----

  * Now using ClassNameManager to get the CSS class name for the highlight
    element, so custom class prefixes other than "yui3" will be respected.
    [Ticket #2530811]


3.4.0
-----

  * Fixed a bug that resulted in invalid escaped HTML when running a highlighter
    with an empty needle. [Ticket #2529945]

  * Fixed an off-by-one bug in which an unhighlighted single char at the end of
    a highlighted string would be discarded when using `allFold()`. [Ticket
    #2530529]


3.3.0
-----

  * Initial release.



History Change History
======================

3.5.0
-----

* Added a workaround for a nasty iOS 5 bug that destroys stored references to
  `window.location` when the page is restored from the page cache. We already
  had a workaround in place since this issue is present in desktop Safari as
  well, but the old workaround no longer does the trick in iOS 5.
  [Ticket #2531608]

* Bug fix: HTML5 history is no longer used by default in Android <2.4, even if
  feature detection shows it's available. It's just too broken.
  [Ticket #2531670]


3.4.1
-----

* No changes.


3.4.0
-----

* [!] The `history-deprecated` module, which was deprecated in YUI 3.2.0, has
  been removed from the library.

* HistoryHTML5 now uses the new `window.history.state` property (which
  showed up in Firefox 4 and the HTML5 spec after YUI 3.3.0 was released) to
  get the current HTML5 history state.

* Removed the `enableSessionStorage` config option that was previously used to
  work around the lack of an HTML5 API for getting the current state.

* Added a `force` config parameter to History constructors. If set to `true`,
  a `history:change` event will be fired whenever the URL changes, even if
  there is no associated state change.

* Bug fix: On a page with a `<base>` element, replacing a hash-based history
  state resulted in a broken URL. [Contributed by Ben Joffe] [Ticket #2530305]

* Bug fix: In IE6 and IE7, navigating to a page with a hash state could result
  in endlessly repeating `history:change` events. [Ticket #2529990]

* Bug fix: In IE6 and IE7, replacing a history state would actually result in
  a new history entry being added. [Ticket #2530301]


3.3.0
-----


* Bug fix: Setting an improperly encoded hash value outside of HistoryHash
  resulted in two history entries being created. [Ticket #2529399]

* Bug fix: Changes to the URL hash (as opposed to the iframe hash) are now
  reflected in the history state in IE6 and IE7. [Ticket #2529400]


3.2.0
-----

* [!] The pre-3.2.0 Browser History Utility has been deprecated, and its
  module has been renamed to `history-deprecated`. It will be removed
  completely in a future release.

* Initial release of the new History Utility.



ImageLoader Change History
==========================

3.5.0
-----
  * No change.

3.4.1
-----

  * No changes.

3.4.0
-----
  * Added classNameAction option for ImgGroup. Setting to "enhanced" means that
   when using className on an <img> element, the src attribute is replaced
   rather than simply removing the class name. [Ticket #2530087]

3.3.0
-----
  * No changes.

3.2.0
-----
  * No changes.

3.1.1
-----
  * No changes.

3.1.0
-----
  * PNG image fix for IE6 [Ticket #2528448]
  * Convert deprecated Y.get calls to Y.one

3.0.0
-----
  * No changes.

3.0.0 beta 1
------------
  * 3.0 conversion
  * New features:
    * Fold groups indicated by a distance from the fold, and images are
      loaded in cascading fashion as each reaches that distance
      Scroll and resize triggers are set automatically for these groups
    * Custom triggers can belong to the global Y instance or to any local event
      target
    * Bg, Src, and Png images are all registered with groups via the same
      "registerImage" method, and differentiated by attribute parameters




Intl Change History

3.5.0
-----

  * No changes.

3.4.1
-----

  * No changes.

3.4.0
-----

  * No changes.

3.3.0
-----

  * No changes.

3.2.0

  * No changes.

3.1.1
-----

  * No changes.

3.1.0
-----

* Initial Release.



IO Utility Change History
=========================

3.5.0
-----

  * Configuration data can now include an instance of FormData for HTTP
    POST requests. [Ticket #2531274]

  * Implemented FormData file upload in io-base. [Ticket #2531274]

  * Fixed transport error in io-base [Ticket #2531308][Ticket #2531941]
    [Ticket #2531947]

  * Fixed IO loader meta-data [Ticket #2531320]

  * Fixed transport error in io-base [Ticket #2531308]

  * Implemented Node.js compatibility [Ticket #2531495]

  * Fixed transport error in io-base [Ticket #2531308]

  * Fixed API docs discrepancy for IO [Ticket #2531756]

  * Fixed error in sending an XML document as POST data. [Ticket #2531257]

  * success/failure/complete/etc callbacks that throw errors no longer
    hijack all future transactions. [Ticket #2532107]

3.4.1
-----

  * HTTP 304 now treated as a success condition. [Ticket #2530931]

  * Fixed transport creation error when both io-xdr and io-upload-iframe
    modules are in use. [Ticket #2530999]

  * Querystring stringify added to io-upload-iframe. [Ticket #2531037]

  * Fixed request abort error in IE. [Ticket #2531038]

  * Add try/catch to io-upload-iframe response to handle failure cases
    where the document may be inaccessible. [Ticket #2531041]

  * Add IO support for XHR basic user authentication. [Ticket #2530023]

  * Revert Y.mix usage for synchronous requests. [Ticket #2531056]

  * Fixed io-upload-iframe transport destruction.  [Ticket #2531058]

3.4.0
-----

  * Added ability to get the configuration of a transaction. [Ticket #2528240]

  * Instantiable IO. [Ticket #2529314]

  * IO now uses `event-custom` and event facades. [Ticket #2529317]

  * Exposed more of the internals of IO for extensibility. [Ticket #2529447]

  * Fixed IO iframe upload to reset form attributes. [Ticket #2529553]

  * Add IO support for XHR basic user authentication. [Ticket #2530023]

  * IO will not send `data` for `GET`, `HEAD` and `DELETE` HTTP methods.
    [Ticket #2530091]

  * Fixed issue with IO doubling the URL query-params on a HTTP `GET` request
    when sending `data` together with form serialization. [Ticket #2530494]

3.3.0
-----

  * When using `io-xdr` to load `io.swf`, a date-time stamp will appended, as a
    query-string, to the transport source for IE. [Ticket #2528898]

  * Implemented default HTTP headers can be suppressed in the transaction's
    configuration object by setting the header with a value of `disable`.
    [Ticket #2529324]

    For example:

        var config = { headers: { "X-Requested-With": "disable" } };

  * Use Y.io without listening for the `io:xdrReady` event. [Ticket #2528710]

  * Fixed native XDR detection for IE8 in `io-xdr`. [Ticket #2529290]

3.2.0
-----

  * Fixed malformed HTML entities in JSON response, when using
    `io-upload-iframe`. [Ticket #2528646]

  * Fixed configuration HTTP headers should override preset HTTP headers, when
    identical. [Ticket #2528893]

3.1.2
-----

  * [!] Fixed security vulnerability in `io-xdr` when using the Flash transport.
    Removed: `Security.allowDomain("*")` setting from `io.as` (source) and
    `io.swf` (compiled). The implementation reverts back to the version in
3.0.0.

    This reversion prevents third-party sites from being able to load `io.swf`
    from a disparate domain, and make HTTP requests with the SWF's domain
    privileges, and passing the domain's credentials.  Only the domain serving
    `io.swf` will be permitted to load it, and call its fields.

    See the "Security Bulletin" for more details:
    http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/io/#security-bulletin

3.1.1
-----

  * Fixed broken synchronous IO requests in IE. [Ticket #2528739]

3.1.0
-----

  * YUI io now supports synchronous transactions for same-domain requests. To
    enable synchronous transactions, set the configuration property `sync` to
    `true`; the default behavior is `false`. During a synchronous request, all
    io events will fire, and response data are accessible through the events.
    Response data are also returned by io, as an alternative. [Ticket #2528181]

    For example:

        var request = Y.io(uri, { sync: true });

    `request` will contain the following fields, when the tx is complete:

      * `id`
      * `status`
      * `statusText`
      * `getResponseHeader()`
      * `getAllResponseHeaders()`
      * `responseText`
      * `responseXML`
      * `arguments`

    When making synchronous requests:

      * The transaction cannot be aborted,
      * The transaction's progress cannot be monitored.

  * `arguments` defined in the configuration object are now passed to io global
    event handlers, as well. [Ticket #2528393]

  * Only pass the value of the `arguments` property to listeners if defined.
    [Ticket #2528313]

3.0.0
-----

  * Native cross-domain transactions are now supported in `io-xdr`. To specify
    an XDR transaction, set the config object with the following properties:

    * `use`: Specify either `native` or `flash` as the desired XDR transport.

    * `credentials`: Set to `true` if cookies are to be sent with the request.
      Does not work with XDomainRequest (e.g., IE8) or the Flash transport.

    * `datatType`: Set to `xml` if the response is an XML document.

    For example:

        var configuration.xdr = {
            use         : 'flash',  // Required -- 'flash` or 'native'.
            credentials : true,     // Optional.
            dataType    : 'xml'     // Optional.
        };

    The `use` property is required. The others are optional or functionality-
    specific.

    When using the native transport, io will fallback to the Flash transport if
    the browser is not capable of supporting the native mode. Make sure the
    resource responds with the correct `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header
    before attempting a native XDR request.

  * The sub-module `datatype-xml` is now a dependency for `io-xdr`, to support
    XML response data in XDR transactions.

  * XDR transport initialization is simplified to one required value -- the path
    to Flash transport. For example:

        Y.io.transport({ src:'io.swf' });

3.0.0beta1
----------

  * The `io-queue` sub-module now implements YUI `Queue`.  The io queue
    interface allows transaction callback handlers to be processed in the order
    the transactions were sent, regardless of actual server response order.
    For example:

    * io queue is used to make three requests.

    * The actual server response order happens to be: transaction 2, 1, 3.

    * However, using the queue interface, the transaction callbacks are
      processed in the order of: transaction 1, 2, 3.

  * All transaction event flows now resolves to `success` or `failure`; the
    abort event is removed. Transaction abort and timeout conditions resolve to
    `failure`, and is distinguishable in the response data. Specifically, the
    response object's `status` and `statusText` properties will be populated as:

    * `response.status` will be 0.

    * `response.statusText` will be set to `timeout` or `abort` to differentiate
      the two possible conditions.

  * A new `end` event is introduced in the transaction event flow; this is the
    terminal event for all transactions. Its event handler signature is the
    same as the `start` event, receiving the transaction id and user-defined
    arguments.

    * The global event name is `io:end`.

    * To subscribe to the transaction event, define the `end` property in the
      transaction's configuration object. `{on: {end: function(){…} } }`.

3.0.0 PR2
---------

  * YUI `io` is now comprised of several modules, allowing users to specify and
    implement only the needed modules. These modules are:

    * `io-base`: This is the IO base class, using `XMLHttpRequest` as the
      transport.

    * `io-xdr`: This sub-module extends IO to enable cross-domain transactions
      using Flash as the transport.

    * `io-form`: This sub-module extends IO to enable the serialization of an
      HTML form as transaction data.

    * `io-upload-iframe`: This sub-module extends IO, to allow file uploads with
      an HTML form, using an `iframe` transport.

    * `io-queue`: This sub-module extends IO to add transaction queuing
      capabilities.

  * If defined in the configuration object, user-specified, HTTP `Content-Type`
    headers will correctly override POST default headers, for HTTP POST
    transactions. [Ticket #SF2262707]

  * XML is not supported as a response datatype when using sub-modules `io-xdr`
    and `io-upload-iframe`.

3.0.0 PR1

-----

  * No changes.

3.2.0
-----

  * Convert parse input to a string before processing.

  * `eval()` now referenced indirectly to allow for better compression.

3.1.1
-----

  * No changes.

3.1.0
-----

  * useNative___ disabled for browsers with *very* broken native APIs
    (FF3.1beta1-3).

  * Assumption of `window` removed to support browser-less environment.

3.0.0
-----

  * Leverages native `JSON.stringify` if available.

  * Added `Y.JSON.useNativeParse` and `useNativeStringify` properties that can
    be set to `false` to use the JavaScript implementations. Use these if your
    use case triggers an edge-case bug in one of the native implementations.
    Hopefully these will be unnecessary in a few minor versions of the A-grade
    browsers.

  * Added support for `toJSON()` methods on objects being stringified.

  * Moved Date stringification before replacer to be in accordance with ES5.

3.0.0beta1
----------

  * Leverages native `JSON.parse` if available.

  * Stringify API change. Third argument changed from depth control to indent
    (Per the ECMA 5 spec).

Initial release



YUI Loader Change History
=========================

### 3.5.0

The biggest change made was the use of the `async` flag on `Y.Get` requests. Loader will now use the
`Y.Loader.resolve()` method under the hood to calculate all the dependencies that it is aware of, then
build the URL's to complete this request. It will then batch those into one `Y.Get` transation and fetch
all of them asynchronously, then return to loader for post processing of the injected dependencies.

   * 2531451 Loading of lang modules doesn't go through configFn in loader
   * 2531590 addModule does not update the global cache so dynamically added skins modules can get lost
   * 2531626 maxURLlength configuration on a per group basis

   * 2531697 Loading a CSS module without specifying 'type=css' will throw a syntax error
   * 2531587 Loader will not load custom modules if combine: true


### 3.4.1

  * No changes.

### 3.4.0
    
   * Added Alias support and flattened the module structure.
   * Alias support: When asking for: "dd"
        Loader actually asks for: "dd-ddm-base,dd-ddm,dd-ddm-drop,dd-drag,dd-proxy,dd-constrain,dd-drop,dd-scroll,dd-drop-plugin"
   * Better RLS support

### 3.3.0

   * 'when' config for conditional modules (before, after, or instead).

### 3.2.0
   * Conditional module support based on user agent detection or test function.
   * Added gallery css support
   * performance optimizations, cached yui metadata, shared instances, etc

### 3.1.1
  * Fixed ticket #2528771 : Loader has incorrect default for "base" - uses Y.Env, instead of Y.Env.base
  * Fixed ticket #2528784 : Regression requesting language packs using Y.use("lang/datatype-date_xx", fn) in build yui3-2029

### 3.1.0
  * Added a 'patterns' property.  Modules that are not predefined will be created with the
    default values if it matches one of the patterns defined for the instance.
  * Added module groups.  This allows for specifying the base path and the combo properties
    for a group of modules.  The combo support now allows for multiple combo domains.
  * Handles simultaneous bootstrapping and loading better.
  * Added support for dynamically loading language packs along with modules that have them.
  * Intrinsic support for loading yui3-gallery modules.
  * Intrinsic support for loading yui2 modules via the 2in3 project.
  * Submodule breakdown to allow use of loader without all of the YUI3 metadata.
  * Metadata is managed per component instead of centrally.
  * Extremely long combo urls are split into multiple requests.
  * Loader defends itself against metadata that creates circular dependencies.

### 3.0.0
  * Extracted from the YUI seed.  Now fetched dynamically if
    there are missing dependencies if not included.
  * Reads metadata from on-page modules registered via Y.add if the module is not already known.
  * Many new modules, many modules reorganized, dependency information has been tuned.

3.0.0
-----

  * No changes.


3.0.0 beta 1
------------

  * Now lives on the `Plugin` namespace, as opposed to the `plugin` namespace.

  * `bind()` supports a string representing a function on the context object in
    order to allow overriding methods on superclasses that are bound to a
    function displaced by AOP.

  * Fixed array handling in `clone()`.

-----

  * Initial release.

  * Modified progressive enhancement use case, to use Document Fragments instead
    of `innerHTML` to preserve event listeners.

  * Fixed use of `centered`, `x` and `y` in the constructor. These all needed
    `lazyAdd` configuration since they had setters which modified other
    attribute state.



Panel Change History
====================

3.5.0
-----

  * Panel now hosts the a default "close" button which can be included more
    easily then before. This button has advanced styling which will render the
    button with the text [Close] when it's in the footer, and with the icon [x]
    when it's in the header. [Ticket #2531680]

        // Panel with close button in header.
        var panel = new Y.Panel({
            buttons: ['close']
        });

        // Panel with close button in footer.
        var otherPanel = new Y.Panel({
            buttons: {
                footer: ['close']
            }
        });

  * Panel's skins now uses `.yui3-panel` instead of `.yui3-panel-content` for
    its CSS selectors where possible. [Ticket #2531623]

  * Moved mask-related styles/skins to `WidgetModality`.

  * See also WidgetButtons' change history.

  * See also WidgetModality's change history.

3.4.1
-----

  * Panel's CSS related to WidgetButtons has been improved. The styling for
    Panel's header is now much more flexible, while maintaining the position of
    the close button across browsers and varying amounts of content.
    [Ticket #2530978]

  * Panel now has a working Night skin. [Ticket #2530937]

  * The sprite image assets for the "close" button on Panels have moved into the
    WidgetButtons extension's assets. [Ticket #2530952]

  * See also Widget and extensions for changes to dependencies.

3.0.0 beta 1
------------

  * Moved Y.Plugin to Y.Plugin.Base

  * Host/Owner object now available through public "host" attribute,

3.0.0PR2 - Initial release
--------------------------



Plugin Host Change History
==========================

3.5.0
-----

  * API corrected for hasPlugin. It returns the plugin if available, otherwise undefined.
    It has always done this, and since they're truthy/falsey, figured it was better than
    changing the behavior, in case folks are using the plugin instance returned by hasPlugin.

3.4.1
-----

  * No changes.

3.4.0
-----

  * The stringify method in querystring-stringify and
    querystring-stringify-simple now accepts a configuration object in the
    second argument. All configuration properties are optional.
    
    For querystring-stringify-simple, the configuration object contains only
    one property: arrayKey.  The default value is false.
    
    For querystring-stringify, the configuration object can be defined with
    three properties (default values are in parenthesis): arrayKey (false),
    eq (=), and sep (&).
    
3.2.0
-----

  * Fixed malformed HTML entities in JSON response, when using
    `io-upload-iframe`. [Ticket #2528646]

ScrollView Change History
=========================

3.5.0
-----

  * Allow scrollbar to work with non-px width scrollviews
  * Added mousewheel support (#2529136)

3.4.1
-----

  * Fixed incorrect scroll width/height calculations to account for
    translate (for real this time) on Chrome, and now Safari. 

    translateZ applied for h/w acceleration was resulting in the incorrect 
    scroll values.

  * Removed fallback to cb.scrollWidth/Height, when determining scroll dimensions.
    This was masking the real problem with translate impacting boundingBox scroll 
    width/height calcs mentioned above.

  * Fixed scrollbar racing ahead of scroll position on FF 5+ with native transition
    support enabled.

  * Added ability to disable scrollview completely, disable flick or disable drag
   
    // Stops SV from moving through flick/drag or the API.
    sv.set("disabled", true); 

    // Stops SV from reacting to flick. Can still drag/scroll through API
    sv.set("flick", false);
 
    // Stops SV from reacting to drag. Can still flick, scroll through API
    sv.set("drag", false);  

  * Resync UI on scrollview-list class application.

3.4.0
-----

  * Fixed _uiDimensionsChange code which was looking explicitly for 
    the "width" attribute. Just plain wrong.

  * Added vertical paging support.

  * Removed DOMSubtreeModified event listening which was only really kicking
    in for Webkit and was too heavy handed. User now needs to call syncUI() 
    manually on all browsers, if the content of the scrollview is changed, 
    and may potentially result in dimension changes.

  * Broke out use of transform3d into a seperate method, and added a protected
    flag, _forceHWTransforms, to allow for customization if required 
    (H/W acceleration related glitches or changing the set of browsers for 
    which we attempt to force it).

  * Created Scrollview-List plugin to provide out-of-the-box handling of
    List (LI) content inside horizontal and vertical ScrollViews. 

  * Fixed incorrect scroll width/height calculations on Chrome 9+, FF
    when syncUI() [ or _uiDimensionsChange() ] was called when the ScrollView
    was scrolled over.
 
  * Protected state flags are now reset if _uiDimensionsChange results in
    flipped orientation.

  * Use the larger of bb.scrollWidth/Height or cb.scrollWidth/Height, to calculate
    scroll dimensions to account for FF (which clips cb.scrollWidth) and 
    Chrome/MacOS (which clips bb.scrollWidth when translated even after 
    incorrect scroll calcs above).
  
3.3.0
-----

  * Fixed shared scrollbar node across multiple instances.

  * Changed async call to _uiDimensionsChange after render, to a sync call.

  * Corrected skin prefix to be yui3-skin-sam instead yui-skin-sam.

  * Refactored for kweight, and broke out scrollview-base-ie conditional module.

  * Don't prevent default on gesturemoveend, so that click listeners on 
    elements inside the scrollview respond reliably. Panning is still prevented 
    by preventing gesturemousemove.

  * Removed generic CSS in scrollview-base.css targeting UL/LI content. The 
    rules were added to support the common use case, but were too broad, and in 
    general, scrollview is content agnostic.

  * The same support can be achieved by adding cssreset to the page (to remove
    LI bullets, padding, margin), and adding inline block rules, when providing
    horizontal scrollview content as a list. These rules are provided below:

    /* To layout horizontal LIs */
    #my-horiz-scrollview-content li {
      display: inline-block;
       *display: inline;
       *zoom:1;
    }

    /* For IE - needs a non-transparent background to pick up events */
    #my-scrollview-content li {
      *zoom:1;
      background-color:#fff;
    }

  * Added prefix-less border radius scrollbar styles for IE9.

  * Made scrollbar-paginator skinnable:false. It has no CSS which is applied,
    out of the box currently. The paginator CSS shipped in 3.2.0, was not actively
    applied.

Slider Change History
=====================

3.5.0
-----

  * Added ARIA roles and states [#2528788]
  * Added keyboard support. Arrows, pageUp/Down, home/end [#2528788]
  * Fixed a bug where set('value', x) could be ignored if the max - min was
    less than the configured length. [#2531498]
  * Added click on thumb or clickable rail gives the thumb focus, allowing 
    keyboard access. [#2531569] 

3.4.1
-----

  * No changes.

3.4.0
-----

  * No changes.

3.3.0
-----

  * Default `thumbUrl` no longer broken when using the seed file from the combo
    service.

3.2.0
-----

  * Leverages touch events when the UA supports them.

  * (un)Swapped skin files for `audio` and `audio-light` skins.

3.1.1
-----

  * No changes.

3.1.0
-----

  * [!] Major refactoring. Broken into `SliderBase`, `ClickableRail`, and
    `SliderValueRange` classes, and `Y.Slider` is the product of
    `Y.Base.build(…)` of these. `SliderBase` is responsible for rendering the UI
    and broadcasting `slideStart`, `slideEnd`, and `thumbMove` events.
    `ClickableRail` adds support for clicking on the `rail` to move the `thumb`.
    `SliderValueRange` adds support for `min`, `max`, and `value` attributes.
    Values are integers ranging from 0 to 100 by default. `Base.build()` in
    different value algorithms or extensions to specialize from `SliderBase`.

  * [!] `railSize` attribute renamed to `length`.

  * [!] `maxGutter` and `minGutter` attributes removed. Use CSS and/or apply
    manually via `slider._dd.con.set('gutter', …);`.

  * [!] `rail`, `thumb`, `thumbImg` `Node` attributes removed, as well as
    `HTML_PARSER` support. Progressive enhancement stems from a value source,
    not a markup source. Various progressive enhancement extensions will arrive
    in future versions.

  * Sam skin updated and 7 new skins added (`sam-dark`, `round`, `round-dark`,
    `capsule`, `capsule-dark`, `audio`, `audio-light`).

  * New markup and CSS structure including separate shadow image (set to same
    image as thumb, positioned via CSS ala sprite.

  * Thumb placement method changed from `setXY()` and `DD` positioning methods
    to simpler `setStyle('left', x)` or `top` for vertical Sliders. Allows
    rendering and modifying in hidden containers without the need to `syncUI()`
    when making visible. Still recommended to call `syncUI()` if rendered off
    DOM, but may not be necessary if using Sam skin. YMMV.

3.0.0
-----

  * Removed noop `_setValueFn()` and the setter config for the `value`
    attribute.

  * Renamed static protected `AXIS_KEYS` to `_AXIS_KEYS`.

  * Renamed `_defUpdateValueFromDD` to `_defThumbDragFn` per naming conventions.

  * Added `_convertOffsetToValue` to mirror `_convertValueToOffset`.

3.0.0beta1
----------

  * Renamed the `valueSet` custom event to `positionThumb` and rejiggered the
    logic of the default function and support methods.

  * renamed `_defSyncUI` to `_defSyncFn` for library nomenclature consistency.

  * Added protected `_convertValueToOffset` to help position the thumb.

  * Set `bubble: false` on the `DD.Drag` instance.

3.0.0pr2
--------

  * Initial release.

Substitute Utility Change History
=================================

3.5.0
-----
  * No change.

3.4.1
-----

  * Now replaces everything if not undefined instead of only objects,
    strings and numbers (@satyam)
  * Added `{LBRACE}` and `{RBRACE}` as possible replacement strings so that
    braces can be included in the resulting string (@satyam)
  * Improved the restoration of undefined replacements (@satyam)

3.4.0
-----

  * No changes.

3.3.0
-----

  * No changes.

3.2.0
-----

  * No change to this utility, but `Y.Lang.sub()` was added to the YUI core.
    This is a lightweight version of the substitute utility that follows the
    same templating syntax, but lacks recursive replacements, object dumping,
    and string formatting. The advantage is that it is very small, and available
    in the YUI core -- perhaps the regular expression implementation will be
    faster than the string manipulation that happens in substitute in some
    situations.

3.1.1
-----

  * No changes.

3.1.0
-----

  * Substitute has a `recurse` option to support nested templates (the previous
    default behavior). Normal operation is now a single level substitution
    which is tolerant of brackets in the replacement string.

Widget Change History
=====================

3.5.0
-----

 * Refactored some of the box stamping code, to avoid Node references
   until render. Changed caching mechanism for Y.Widget.getByNode to use node.get("id")

 * Patched after listeners in Widget with a if (e.target === this), so that homogenous 
   bubbles don't end up changing state at both the source and the target. Broader
   fix needs to go into Event/EventTarget

 * Optimized focus handler registration, by only registering a single document focus
   listener and using Widget.getByNode to ship out handling to the specific widget
   instance.

 * Widget will now default to an empty object config, if one isn't passed in, 
   so that HTML_PARSER can work with a static ATTRS srcNode definition.

   It's not possible to address this just at the HTML_PARSER level, since the config 
   object gets used by reference, so we need to make sure everything is updating the
   config object which is passed to Base's initialization chain.

3.4.1
-----

  * No changes.

3.4.0
-----

  * Added workaround in destructor for single box widgets (contentBox === boundingBox)
    Also extracted DOM removal into separate method, which can be overridden
    if custom widgets don't want rendered DOM removed.

  * Fixed UI_EVENTS js exception when dealing with nested widgets rendered 
    by different Y instances.

  * Fixed UI_EVENTS invoking nested widget listeners more than once (also
    fixed regression to Parent-Child as a result of this change).

  * Added support for destroy(true) to Widget, which will remove and
    destroy all child nodes (not just the boundingBox and contentBox)
    contained within the Widget's boundingBox in order to help control
    Node cache size over long-running applications.

    destroy() will maintain its current behavior due to the potentially 
    high run-time cost of destroying all child nodes.

    Widget developers still need to continue with the best practice of 
    destroying explicit node references they create, in their destructors 
    to support the destroy() case.
	
3.3.0
-----

  * HTML_PARSER now return null instead of an empty node list, if no nodes
    are found, when using the [selector] syntax, so that the default value
    will be applied for the attribute.

  * UI_EVENTS support and skin util methods (only getSkinName currently) 
    broken out of widget-base into separate submodules, widget-uievents and 
    widget-skin. 
  
  * widget-base-ie broken out as conditional module.

  * Fixed widget-locale support. Needed lazyAdd:false, for strings attribute

  * Changed widget UI_EVENTS type parsing, to use EventTarget.parseType and 
    removed after() override, since everything ends up going through on() 
    eventually. 

3.2.0
-----

  * Minimized widget dependencies from the complete node, base rollups,
    to only the node and base submodules widget actually uses

  * Fixed issue in UI_EVENTS handling, where removing the last listener for
    a ui event, didn't clear out the _delegates hash even though the handler
    was detached (for example,  in tabview, if you remove all tabs, and then 
    add a new tab, clicking on the new tab didn't work.)

3.1.1
-----

  * Fixed ticket #2528758 : using widget's DOM event facade ends with error during destroy
  * Fixed ticket #2528760 : _applyParsedConfig merges arrays, instead of letting user config win
  * "init, render and destroy listeners now called synchronously, if event already fired (see Event README)"

3.1.0
-----

  * "render" event now published with the defaultTargetOnly set to true.

  * Added support for MyWidget.CSS_PREFIX static property 
    to let developers define their own CSS PREFIX instead of 
    yui-<MyWidget.NAME>. 

  * Changed default value for the tabIndex attribute to null, meaning by default 
    a Widget's bounding box will not be a focusable element.

  * Widget now has built-in support for Progressive Enhancement.  

    1. The document element (HTML) is now stamped with a class name 
       (yui-js-enabled) indicating that JS is enabled allowing for the 
       creation of JS-aware Widget CSS style rules for Progressive Enhancement.

    2. Widget has support for a class name representing the "loading" 
       state that can be used in combination with the "yui-js-enabled" class name 
       to create style rules for widgets that are in the process of loading.  
       There is support for use of both a generic Widget and type-specific 
       Widget class name by default (for example:  "yui-widget-loading" and 
       "yui-tabview-loading").

    3. Widget's renderer will remove the "loading" class names from the 
       bounding box allowing the fully rendered and functional widget to be 
       revealed.
  
    Developer Usage / Requirements
  
    Developers can take advantage of the system by following two steps:
  
    1. Simply stamping the bounding box of their widgets with the 
       corresponding "loading" state class name.  The idea being that the markup
       for this widget is already on the page, and the JS components required 
       to transform/bring the widget to life are in the process of loading.
      
    2. Providing the definition of the loading style for the widget(s).
  
  * Removed parentNode.inDoc() check from render, to allow implementations
    to render to parentNodes which are document fragments. If rendering to 
    a document fragment, the implementation is responsible for adding the 
    document fragment to the document during the render lifecycle phase.

  * Split widget module into the following sub-modules

    1. widget-base : Core lifecycle and API support. 
    2. widget-htmlparser : HTML parser support.

    The "widget" module, is a roll up of the widget-base and widget-htmlparser 
    submodules. 

    The widget-locale is a standalone module, which contains the deprecated
    Internationalization support and has been replaced by the Y.Intl language
    pack support, to allow strings to be defined separately from code.

  * Removed moveStyles support for 3.1. Can be re-added if required, but 
    currently does not seem to be in use. 

  * Made render event fireOnce (along with init and destroy in Base) 

  * Widget will now fire user-generated events like DOM elements do (e.g. 
    'click', 'mouseover').  Like all other Widget events, these events are 
    prefixed with the Widget name (e.g. 'menuitem:click') and the default 
    context of the event listener will be the Widget that fired the event.

    The goals/purpose of the Widget UI events are: 

    1. Provide developers with the ability to listen for UI events as though the 
       Widget is an atomic element, as opposed to DOM events that will bubble up 
       through all of the elements that compose a Widget's UI.

    2. These are events that many Widget instances are going to want to publish 
       and fire, so Widget does this by default to ensure that these events are
       fired in a performant, consistent way across Widget implementations.

    Additional info:

    1. Widget developers don't have to explicitly publish a given UI event in 
       order for Widget consumers to listen for them.  By default UI events are
       only published and fired if someone is listening for them.
       
    2. Widget developers can choose to publish a given UI event in order to 
       explicitly control some aspect of the event.  The most likely use case
       is the desire to provide the default implementation/handler for a given 
       event.  For example: a developer might want to publish a click event 
       for a Menu Widget with the goal of providing the default click 
       implementation/function (what gets canceled if a listener calls 
       the preventDefault() method.)

    3. The set of user-generated events published by widget is defined by the 
       UI_EVENTS prototype property.  Widget developers can use this property 
       to pair down or extend the number of events that are published and 
       fired automatically.
  
    4. For performance, these events are only created when someone is 
       listening, and the actual firing of these events is facilitated by a 
       single, delegated DOM event listener.  

  * content box now expands to fill bounding box. CSS is used for browsers
    which support box-sizing:border-box. Expansion is handled programmatically 
    for others (currently IE6 & IE7). Maybe some edge cases which need 
    resolution.

  * Added an "id" attribute.

  * Added support for auto-rendering of widgets at the end of construction, 
    using the "render" attribute.

  * Added support for single-box widgets (contentBox and boundingBox can 
    point to same node). 

    Widget developers can set CONTENT_TEMPLATE to null if they have a 
    widget which doesn't need dual-box support.

  * Added _bindAttrUI and _syncAttrUI sugar methods, to bind after listeners
    and sync methods, by attribute name.

  * The widget's bounding box is now removed from the DOM and destroyed
    when the widget it destroyed.

  * Added "srcNode" attribute, which acts as the root for HTML_PARSER.
 
    This allows widgets to support progressive enhancement, without having
    to put the burden on the user to create and point to bounding boxes,
    or content boxes.

  * Added protected _getSrcNode and _applyParsedConfig methods to allow for 
    HTML_PARSER customization, by allowing Widget developers to customize 
    the node passed into _parseNode on the input side, and the final merged
    configuration on the output side of the srcNode parsing process. 

    The default Widget _getSrcNode implementation uses "srcNode" if set, 
    otherwise falls back to "contentBox", for 3.0.0 compatibility.

    The default Widget _applyParsedConfig implementation aggregates the user
    configuration literal, with the configuration output from parsed node,
    with the user configuration taking precedence. 

    NOTE: All HTML_PARSER related changes are backward compatible. 

    Existing Widget implementations should still work. However HTML_PARSER 
    implementations based on contentBox being the root node should be
    modified to work off of srcNode before the 3.1.0 release.

3.0.0
-----

  * No Changes

3.0.0 beta 1
------------

  * PluginHost moved down to Base.

  * Render event args added to event facade instead of being passed
    across separately (e.parentNode).

  * "hasFocus" attribute renamed to "focused"

  * "focused" attribute is read only

  * "focused" attribute is set via:
    1. user interaction
    2. the "focus" and "blur" methods

  * Only one DOM focus event handler is used now (two for WebKit) and it is 
    bound to the widget's ownerDocument.  This allows modal widgets to maintain
    a reference to the element in the document that previously had focus and 
    to be able to restore that focus when the modal widget is hidden.

  * "tabIndex" attribute was updated
    1. accepts a number or null
    2. more documentation

Widget Buttons Change History
=============================

3.5.0
-----

  * [!] WidgetButtons has been completely rewritten, back-compat for common
    usage has been maintained. The new version is _much more_ robust.
    [Tickets #2531366, #2531624, #2531043]

  * [!] The `buttons` attribute is handled in an _extremely_ flexible manner.
    It supports being a single Array, or an Object of Arrays keyed to a
    particular section.

    The `buttons` collection will be normalized into an Object which contains an
    Array of `Y.Node`s for every `WidgetStdMod` section (header, body, footer)
    which has one or more buttons. The structure will end up looking like this:

        {
            header: [...],
            footer: [...]
        }

    A button can be specified as a Y.Node, config Object, or String name for a
    predefined button on the `BUTTONS` prototype property. When a config Object
    is provided, it will be merged with any defaults provided by a button with
    the same `name` defined on the `BUTTONS` property. [Ticket #2531365]

  * [!] All button nodes have the `Y.Plugin.Button` plugin applied.

  * [!] The HTML structure for buttons has been optimized to:

        <span class="yui3-widget-butons>
            <button class="yui3-button">Foo</button>
        </span>

    The above structure will appear in each `WidgetStdMod` section
    (header/body/footer) which contains buttons. [Ticket #2531367]

  * Fixed issue with multiplying subscriptions to `buttonsChange` event. The
    event handler was itself subscripting _again_ to the event causing an
    ever-increasing number of subscriptions all doing the same work. Now
    WidgetButtons will always clean up its event subscriptions.
    [Ticket #2531449]

  * Added support for predefining `BUTTONS` on the prototype. `BUTTONS` is
    Collection of predefined buttons mapped by name -> config. These button
    configurations will serve as defaults for any button added to a widget's
    buttons which have the same `name`. [Ticket #2531680]

  * Added an `HTML_PARSER` implementation for the `buttons` attribute. This
    allows the initial value for a widget's `buttons` to be seeded from its DOM.

  * A widget's `buttons` now persist after header/body/footer content updates.
    Option 2 of the follow scenario has been implemented:
    http://jsfiddle.net/ericf/EXR52/

  * A button can be configured with a `context` object (which defaults to the
    widget instance), which will be used as the `this` object when calling a
    button's `action` or `events` handlers. [Ticket #2531166]

  * Buttons now support multiple `events` which can be specified in place of an
    `action`. The follow are equivalent:

        var buttonConfigWithEvents = {
            label: 'Foo',
            events: {
                click: function (e) {
                    this.hide();
                }
            }
        };

        var buttonConfigWithAction = {
            label : 'Foo',
            action: 'hide'
        };

    A button's `action` can now be specified as the String name of a function
    which is hosted on the `context` object. [Ticket #2531363]

  * Added the notion of a default button. A widget's `defaultButton` will have
    the "yui3-button-primary" CSS class added to it, and will be focused when
    the widget is shown.

  * Updated the `addButton()` method and added other accessor/mutator methods:
    `getButton()` and `removeButton()`.

  * Buttons can now be added to a widget's body, not just the header and footer.

3.4.1
-----

  * Added support for `classNames` property for button configurations which will
    add the CSS class names to the button Node. The default "close" button uses
    this, adding a `yui3-button-close` CSS class to itself. [Ticket #2531091]

  * Fixed the default template for the "close" button to not contain malformed
    HTML by replacing the `<div>` element inside of a `<span>` with a `<span>`.
    The in-lined CSS in the style attribute on the button was moved into an
    external CSS file which provides the basic styling for the default "close"
    button for both the Sam and Night skins. The CSS class `yui3-widget-buttons`
    is now applied to the `boundingBox` of Widgets which use WidgetButtons.
    [Ticket #2530952]

  * Fixed a bug where instance-level properties were not being initialized
    causing references to bubble-up the chain to the prototype incorrectly.
    [Ticket #2530998]

3.4.0
-----

  * Initial release.



Widget Child Change History
===========================

3.5.0
-----

  * No changes.

3.4.1
-----

  * No changes.

3.4.0
-----

  * No changes

3.3.0
-----

  * Changed instanceof to Y.instanceOf, to prevent leaks in IE7

3.2.0
-----

  * No changes

3.1.1
-----

  * No changes

3.1.0
-----

  * Add new ROOT_TYPE property to constrain the behavior of the "root" attribute 
    to instances of a specified type
    
  * Fixes to remove method so that it always returns a reference to the 
    child removed



Widget Modality Change History
==============================

3.5.0
-----

  * Initialization logic will now always run, even when a widget is constructed
    with `{modal: false}`; previously the initialization logic did not run in
    this case. [Ticket #2531401]

  * Fixed destruction lifecycle bug. The mask is now removed when no modal
    widgets are visible on the page. This also fixed an issue with multiple
    modal widget and their `visible` attribute.
    [Ticket #2531484, #2531821, #2531812]

  * Moved mask-related styles/skins out of Panel and into WidgetModality.

3.4.1
-----

  * Fixed focus-contention issues which caused infinite recursion when multiple
    modal Panels were visible on the page at the same time. [Ticket #2530953]

  * It is now possible to instantiate a Widget that uses the WidgetModality
    extension without needing to pass in a configuration Object.
    [Contributed by Jakub Kuźma] [Ticket #2531086]

  * Replaced references to `document` with `Y.config.doc`. [Ticket #2531220]

3.4.0
-----

  * Initial release.



Widget Parent Change History
============================

3.5.0
-----

  * Removing a focused child, now unsets activeDescendant properly

3.4.1
-----

  * Fixed issue with children not being destroyed, when
    parent.destroy() is called.

  * Added if (sibling.get("rendered")) check before trying to insert 
    children after/before siblings. This is not required for the out of
    the box Parent/Child implementation, but is useful for custom 
    implementations which customize children to render asynchronously.

    See #2529863

  * Fixed issue where previously rendered children, added to an empty parent,
    would not get rendered into the parent's child container node.

    Based on the pull request from andreas-karlsson, with the root fix *and* unit
    test (nicely done): https://github.com/yui/yui3/pull/25

3.4.0
-----

  * No changes

3.3.0
-----

  * Changed instanceof to Y.instanceOf, to prevent leaks in IE7
  * Renamed "type" in child configuration, to "childType", so that
    children can have a "type" attribute for it's own context
    (A FormElement widget for examplei, with a "type").

    "type" is still supported but deprecated for backward compatibility,
    so it's only used to define a child widget type if "childType" is not
    provided.
  * Fixed remove(), to actually remove child from DOM also.

3.2.0
-----

  * No changes

3.1.1
-----

  * No changes

3.1.0
-----

  *   "childAdded" event renamed to "addChild"
  *   "childRemoved" event renamed to "removeChild"
  *   Now augmented with Y.ArrayList
  *   "selection" attribute now returns an Y.ArrayList or Widget
  *   Removed "children" attribute since that functionality is provided 
      by Y.ArrayList
	  -  Can retrieve # of child via the size() method
	  -  Can iterate children via this.each()
	  -  Can retrieve a individual child via the item() method
  * add method will always return a Y.ArrayList instance for easy chaining
  * removeAll method will always return a Y.ArrayList instance for easy chaining
  * added selectAll() and deselectAll() methods
  * widget UI will render children added/inserted children after widget is rendered
  * widget UI will update when a child is removed

  * Fixed ability to set individual x, y values.



Widget Position Align Change History
====================================

3.5.0
-----

  * No changes.

3.4.1
-----

  * The widget's alignment is now re-synced to the DOM every time the widget's
    `visible` Attribute is changed to `true`. [Ticket #2530779]

  * Syncing the current alignment to the DOM is now supported in the public API
    by calling `align()` with no arguments. [Ticket #2529911]

3.4.0
-----

  * Added `alignOn` attribute which allows the implementer to specify when the
    Widget should be re-aligned.

3.3.0
-----

  * No changes.

3.2.0
-----

  * No changes.

3.1.1

  * No changes.

3.1.0
-----

  * Initial release.



Widget Stack Change History
===========================

3.5.0
-----

  * [!] Default `zIndex` was reverted back to `0` now that parsing works
    correctly.

  * `zIndex` is now correctly parsed from a widget's `srcNode` using an updated
    `HTML_PARSER` implementaiton. [Ticket 2530186] [PR #68] [Hat tip Pat Cavit]

3.4.1
-----

  * The shim element is now sizing correctly the first time a widget is shown
    after it was instantiated with the `visible` Attribute set to `false`. Note:
    The shim element is only used with IE 6 by default. [Ticket #2529127]

3.4.0
-----

  * No changes.

3.3.0
-----

  * No changes.

3.2.0
-----

  * No changes.

3.1.1
-----

  * No changes.

3.1.0
-----

  * No changes.

3.0.0
-----

  * Initial release.

  * Recreate iframe shim from `TEMPLATE` for each instance, instead of cloning a
    class level cached Node instance, so that `ownerDocument` can be set to
    match the `boundingBox`.



Widget Std Mod Change History
=============================

3.5.0
-----

  * Added `forceCreate` option to `getStdModNode()` method which, if true, will
    create the section node if it does not already exist. [Ticket #2531214]

3.4.1
-----

  * No changes.

3.4.0
-----

  * Move attribute event listeners to `_renderUIStdMod()` method so that
    `setStdModContent()` can be called on `renderUI()`.

3.3.0
-----

  * [!] Removed `_addNodeHTML()`, and renamed `_addNodeRef()` to
    `_addStdModContent()` (both private), since one method now handles both
    Strings and Node/NodeLists.

  * Changed instanceof to Y.instanceOf, to prevent leaks in IE7.

  * Moved to `node.insert()` for content management, since it now handles
    Strings, Nodes and NodeLists. This also fixes an issue where  resetting the
    content to the existing content (e.g. calling `syncUI()`), would blow away
    the content in IE.

3.2.0
-----

  * Setting content to `null` (or `undefined`, or `NaN`), will remove section
    from the std mod.

3.1.1
-----

  * No changes.

3.1.0
-----

  * Changed widget stdmod `renderUI()`/`syncUI()`/`bindUI()` to `Y.before`, so
    that they are called before the Widget implementation, and setup the
    `header`/`body`/`footer` Node references for the Widget impl to use.

  * Setting section content to `""` will now create the respective section.

  * Fixed `fillHeight`, to work with `contentBox` height, now that it fills
    `boundingBox`.

  * Fixed `setStdModContent("markupString", AFTER | BEFORE)` so that it uses
    `node.append()`, `node.prepend()` instead of `innerHTML` to maintain event
    listeners.

  * `fillHeight` is now invoked when `height` is changed. It was not being
    invoked because of a typo in the event name.

3.0.0
-----

  * Initial release.

  * Cleaned up the way `headerContent`, `bodyContent`, `footerContent` are
    configured, so that the actual stored value is always accurate, without the
    need for a getter which talks to the DOM directly.

  * Recreate sections from `TEMPLATE` string for each instance, instead of
    cloning a class level cached Node instance, so that `ownerDocument` can be
    set to match the `contentBox`.

  * Replaced use of `innerHTML` for progressive enhancement use case with a
    Document Fragment when parsing and then setting `headerContent`,
    `bodyContent`, `footerContent` in `HTML_PARSER` impl, to maintain event
    listeners etc.



YQL Change History
==================

### 3.5.0

No changes.

### 3.4.1

    No changes.

### 3.4.0
    
    #2530246 - Fixed bug in yql module where options ('opts') were not actually being used.  This prevented use YQL calls over SSL, which some tables require.

### 3.3.0

    #2529504 - Added support for JSONP allowCache setting to make YQL requests use the same callback

### 3.2.0

    Initial Release



YUI Core Change History
=======================

3.5.0
-----

* YUI now runs natively on Node.js without a shim. See README.nodejs.md for
  details.

* YUI now detects non-native ES5 shims added to native objects by other
  libraries and falls back to its own internal shims rather than relying on the
  potentially broken code from the other library.

* Added static YUI.applyConfig to apply config settings to YUI.GlobalConfig in
  parts instead of in whole. [Ticket #2530970]

* Added `Y.getLocation()` which returns the `location` object from the
  window/frame in which a YUI instance operates. [Ticket #2531608]

* Added a `useNativeES5` YUI config option, which is `true` by default. If
  `false`, certain YUI features that check for native ES5 functionality will
  always fall back to non-native implementations even in ES5 browsers (useful
  for testing).

* `Y.Array.indexOf()` now supports a `fromIndex` argument for full ES5
  compatibility. [Based on a patch from Ryuichi Okumurua]

* `Y.Object.isEmpty()` now casts the given value to an object if it isn't one
  already, which prevents exceptions when it's given a non-object.

* Fixed issue #2531247: Namespace function behaves wrong with multiple
  arguments.

* Fixed issue #2531512: 'debug' parameter missing from the YUI Config object
  documentation.

* 2530970 Should we provide a YUI.applyConfig(), to avoid clobbering of YUI_config in 'mashup' use cases
* 2531164 Natively use YUI Gallery Modules form does not submit on [enter]
* 2531247 namespace function behaves wrong with multiple arguments
* 2531512 'debug' parameter missing from the YUI Config object documentation; the Config object documentation ...
* 2531550 Prepare npm package for 3.5.0
* 2531551 Add support for Silk in Y.UA
* 2531612 Wrong module name in YUI Global Object documentation


3.4.1
-----

* Sparse arrays are now handled correctly in the non-native fallback
  implementation of `Y.Array.indexOf()`. [Ticket #2530966]

* `Y.mix()` will no longer shadow prototype properties on the receiver unless
  the `overwrite` parameter is true. This was the pre-3.4.0 behavior, but was
  changed in 3.4.0. We're changing it back to preserve backwards compatibility.
  [Ticket #2530501]

* The non-native fallback implementation of `Y.Object.keys()` now contains a
  workaround for buggy browsers that treat function `prototype` properties as
  enumerable in violation of the ES5 spec.

* `Y.Object.size()` now returns `0` for non-objects. This was the pre-3.4.0
  behavior, but regressed in 3.4.0. [Ticket #2531069]


3.4.0
-----

* Added `Y.Array.dedupe()`, which provides an optimized solution for deduping
  arrays of strings. When you know an array contains only strings, use `dedupe`,
  since it's faster than `unique`.

* `Y.Lang.isArray()` now uses the native ES5 `Array.isArray()` method when
  possible.

* `Y.Object()` now uses the native ES5 `Object.create()` method when possible.

* `Y.Object.keys()` now uses the native ES5 `Object.keys()` method when
  possible.

* Sparse arrays are now handled correctly in the non-native fallback
  implementations of `Y.Array.each`, `Y.Array.hash`, and `Y.Array.some`.
  [Ticket #2530376]


3.3.0
-----

* Added fast path for repeat calls to `use()` with the same arguments.

* Added a `Y.destroy()` method, which destroys the YUI instance.

* Added `Y.Lang.now()`, which returns the current time in milliseconds.

* Added `YUI.GlobalConfig` to allow three stages of configuration
  (`YUI.GlobalConfig` --> `YUI_Config` --> instance configs). This is helpful in
  non-browser environments for supplying a global config for the YUI container.


3.2.0
-----

* Added `Y.Lang.sub()`, which is a very lightweight version of `Y.substitute()`.

* `Y.Array.hash()` no longer skips falsy values.

* Script errors in module and `use()` callback functions are caught and routed
  through `Y.error`.

* `Y.error` invokations can be monitored with the `errorFn` configuration.

* Returning `true` from the `errorFn` will prevent the script error from halting
  further script execution.

* Added UA properties for mobile devices and ensured that UA is only evaluated
  once.

* The YUI global will overwrite itself when included again, while attempting to
  preserve the global environment of previous instances.

* Added a remote loader service submodule.

* Added a features submodule.  This is used by the capability-based loader
  when dispatching to a remote loader service.


3.1.1
-----

* Removed the limit on the number of config objects you can supply to the
  `YUI` constructor.


3.1.0
-----

* YUI will attempt to fetch newly discovered dependencies after a module is
  dynamically loaded.

* The `documentElement` (`<html>`) is now stamped with a `yui3-js-enabled`
  classname to indicate that JS is enabled. This allows for the creation of
  JS-aware CSS style rules that progressively enhance the page.

* Added the ability to define a global configuration object (`YUI_config`).

* Added `Y.Object.some()` and `Y.some()`, which are analogous to
  `Y.Array.some()`.

* UA refinements for Chrome, Android and other browsers/platforms.

* Added `last()` to `Queue` for LIFO support.

* Added throttle utility to buffer expensive functions that are called
  frequently.

* The `YUI.add()` callback now gets the module name as the second parameter for
  generic processing of similar modules.

* Added `intl-base` submodule to process the decision tree for selecting
  language packs when dynamically loading internationalized modules.

* `Y.guid()` generates identifiers that are safe to use as HTML attributes.

* Improved persistent messaging for missing modules/functionality.

* Bootstrapping improved to prevent simultaneous loading of resources when
  multiple instances are launched at the same moment.

* The YUI script source URL is read in order to try to dynamically determine the
  base path for loading resources on demand.

* The core loads without errors in non-browser environments.


3.0.0
-----

* Extracted the loader from the seed file. If loader is not available, but `get`
  is and dependencies are missing, the loader will be fetched before continuing.

* User agent detection is more granular. For example, Firefox 3.5 reports Gecko
  1.91 rather than 1.9.

* Fixed `Y.UA.os`.

* Added additional mobile device detection.

* Get utility cleans up attribues before purging nodes.

* `Y.cached` accepts a parameter to refresh a cached value.

* `yui-log` and `yui-later` are now optional modules that are included with
  `yui.js`.

* `queue-base` is no longer a submodule of `queue` -- it's now part of
  `yui-base`.

* All YUI submodules end up in the `yui` build directory.

* Dynamic loading can be disabled by setting the `bootstrap` config to `false`.


3.0.0 beta 1
-----

### Core

* `Y.fail` has been renamed to `Y.error` so that `Y.fail` can be used for the
  assertion engine.

* `Y.stamp` now accepts a `readOnly` parameter to be used when you are only
  interested in reading an existing guid rather than creating a new one.

* `Y.stamp` defends against stamping items that can't be stamped.

* Added to `Y.Object`: `values()`, `hasKey()`, `hasValue()`, `size()`,
  `getValue()`, `setValue()` (the latter two are for manipulating nested
  values).

* `Y.use` calls are queued during dynamic loading.

* Added `Y.cached` for function memoizing

* Added `numericSort` to `Y.Array`.

* The `yui:log` event broadcasts globally.

### Lang

* Added `Y.Lang.type` (`typeof` abstraction) and refactored some 'is' methods to
  use it.

### Get

* Accepts an attribute collection config to apply to inserted nodes.

* `id` attributes are globally unique

* Now accepts `purgethreshold` as a config option. This will set the number of
  transactions required before auto removing nodes from previous transactions
  (default is 20).

### Loader

* `yuitest` renamed to `test`, now requires `collection`.

* Lots of new module metadata.

* Added `onCSS`.

* Loader requests are queued globally.

* Accepts `jsAttributes` and `cssAttributes` configs for adding attributes to
  inserted nodes

* Added `force` config.

### UA

* Added `secure` property for SSL detection.

* Added `os` property for OS detection.

* Added Adobe Air and Google Caja detection.


3.0.0pr2
--------

### Core

* The initial dependency calculation should not allow automatic rollup.

* `Y.fail` will throw/rethrow errors by default (`throwFail` is now `true`).

* `Y.namespace` reverted to scrub `YAHOO` out if included as the first level of
  the namespace.

* `useConsole` config changed to `useBrowserConsole`.


### Array

* Added `Y.Array.some()`.


### Get

* Protects against trailing commas in the array of files to load.


### Loader

* `get` requires `yui-base`.

* `loader` requires `get`.

* Combo URL build process defends against undefined modules.

* Added combo handler support for CSS.

* Filters are correctly applied to combo and fullpath URLs.

* Added `compat`, `profiler`, `yuitest`, `widget`, `stylesheet`,
  `classnamemanager`, `overlay`, `plugin`, `slider`, and `console` modules.

* Added `io` submodules.

* `queue` requires `event`.

* Added submodule metadata logic.

* Added plugin metadata logic.

* Added skin metadata logic.


3.0.0pr1
--------

* Initial release.
